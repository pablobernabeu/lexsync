# Balance-aware list assignment (`counterbalance.optimise`).
#
# The factorial recipe deals item sets to lists by rank, which balances nothing: any
# dimension that varies smoothly across set ids is dealt out unevenly, and where each
# list goes to a different group of participants that unevenness is confounded with the
# group. balance_lists() searches for an assignment whose lists are equated instead.
#
# Two properties are load-bearing and each is pinned here.
#
# The search must be identical in the two engines, so the objective is all-integer.
# Cohen's d was measured to differ between R and Python by around 3e-16, which at nine
# decimal places leaves roughly a one-in-three chance over a full run of a candidate
# comparison resolving differently -- and the failure would be silent and total,
# different words rather than different last bits. The assignment asserted below is
# pinned character for character against test_balance.py.
#
# It must be off by default. Switching it on changes which items a participant sees, so
# a design that does not ask for it has to be unaffected.
#
# python_workflow/tests/test_balance.py asserts the same properties.

# handles worst: it hands every Nth set to the same list.
