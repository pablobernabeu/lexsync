# The pair-keyed item model: member norms, relational dimensions, pair selection.
#
# A relational design's predictor is a property of the PAIR while its controls are
# properties of each MEMBER, so it needs an item table and selection at the same
# time. Until this existed a design could have one or the other.
#
# Three properties are load-bearing and each has a test here.
#
# The member prefix leads (`prime.frequency`, never `frequency.prime`). R's `$`
# partial-matches on a data frame, so a joined `word.frequency` with no bare `word`
# would make the selector's tie-break silently sort by it here while the Python
# engine raised KeyError. The reserved-name check prevents that class of divergence.
#
# Selection runs on one row per pair and re-expands. A filter on `target.frequency`
# applied row-wise would keep a pair's related row and drop its unrelated one,
# leaving a set the Latin-square counterbalancer cannot complete.
#
# `pair.overlap` is computed in-engine, which is only safe because the core is an
# integer edit distance and the arithmetic uses no transcendental.
# python_workflow/tests/test_pairs.py asserts the same values.
