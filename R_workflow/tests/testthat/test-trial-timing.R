# Per-trial event durations: jittered, or read from an item column.
#
# A fixed duration is a property of the design; one that varies from trial to
# trial is a property of the trial, and therefore a variable the analysis needs.
# Both forms are resolved into the stimuli table before anything is generated, so
# the realised milliseconds travel with the stimuli rather than living only inside
# the presentation script.
#
# The jitter draws no random number. It is a uniform integer keyed on the seed,
# the column name, the list, the set and the condition, so the two engines realise
# the same milliseconds and a rerun reproduces them. Naming the column in the key
# is what makes two jittered events in one design draw independently instead of
# sharing a value.
#
# python_workflow/tests/test_trial_timing.py asserts the same values.
