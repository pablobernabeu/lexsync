#
# These exist because the package's byte-identity claim was failing in a way nothing
# caught. Two designs' reported means differed between the engines in the last decimal
# the descriptives publish -- 1.448 against 1.447 -- because R's mean() uses a two-pass
# long-double algorithm while numpy sums pairwise, and the true value sat on a rounding
# boundary. Every reduction in validation.R now goes through these instead.
#
# The algorithm is Neumaier compensated summation, written out in plain double
# arithmetic in both engines: every operation is +, -, abs or a comparison, and IEEE-754
# requires + and - to be correctly rounded, so the two engines cannot disagree. That is
# an argument rather than a measurement, which is what relying on R's long-double
# accumulator amounted to.
#
# python_workflow/tests/test_exact_reductions.py asserts the same properties, and
# test_byte_parity.py checks the end result on the real artefacts.
