# The experiment templates are mirrored into both packages; the mirrors must match.
#
# templates/ at the repository root is the canonical copy. Both packages carry
# their own so an installed copy can reach one without the repository: the R
# package under inst/templates/, the Python package under src/lexsync/templates/,
# and each resolves its own through .lexsync_template() / find_template().
#
# Nothing enforced that the three agree, and no functional test can. A stale
# mirror is still a perfectly valid template: it renders, it runs, and the
# experiment it produces is simply not the one the repository documents. For the
# trigger templates that is worse than ordinary staleness, because what drifts is
# the code time-locking EEG markers to stimulus onset, and an experiment that
# records the wrong onset does not fail -- it quietly collects unusable data.
#
# So compare the bytes. Twinned with python_workflow/tests/test_templates.py.
# Repository-level checks skip gracefully when the package is checked in
# isolation, as test-config.R already does.
