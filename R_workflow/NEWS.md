# lexsync (development version)

* The Shiny app takes the lexsync accent, the deep violet the documentation site
  uses, in place of Bootswatch's cosmo blue. That blue reached only 3.97:1 against
  the white label of the full-width 'Run design' button, short of the 4.5:1 the
  size calls for, and the app looked unlike both its Streamlit twin and the
  package's own sites. The Streamlit app declares the same accent.
* The Shiny app's realised-control chart leaves a gap where Cohen's d is undefined.
  The bars were summed into their cells, which writes a zero for a comparison that
  is absent or undefined, so a dimension on which both conditions are constant, the
  case the datasheet reports as '--', drew the bar of a perfectly matched dimension.
  The Streamlit chart already omitted it.
* Two messages name the alternatives, as every other 'unknown X' message in the
  package does. An unrecognised event type in a design's `events:` list now ends
  'Known types: fixation, text, mask, blank, region_by_region, response, question,
  feedback.', and an unrecognised `items.generation.method` names the two
  generators. An event carrying no `type` at all reaches the same message rather
  than base R's 'argument is of length zero'.
* `resample_stimuli()` refuses an `n_sets` that is not a positive whole number, the
  test `run_pipeline()` already applies to `n_per_condition`. Zero returned an empty
  result the pipeline then reported nothing about, and a fractional number was
  truncated in silence.
* The run log writes the TOST p at four places, the number of places it is stored
  at. It was rounded to three here and printed in full by the Python engine, so the
  two provenance records of one run quoted different numbers for the same statistic.
* `balance_check()` names a column's levels in byte order. `table()` ordered them
  by the session's collation and the Python twin's `value_counts` by descending
  count, so the same stimuli produced two differently worded warnings, in the run
  log among other places, and the R wording depended on the locale.
* An explicit `registry_path` that does not exist is refused with lexsync's own
  message rather than the connection error `file()` raises. The Python twin
  accepted such a path and read whichever registry its search list found next,
  reporting another file's corpora under the one the caller named, so both
  engines now refuse it alike.
* The `registry.yaml` bundled with the package is byte-identical to
  `corpora/registry.yaml` again, and the suite holds the two together as it
  already does for the schema. The mirror had fallen a line behind, the line
  documenting the optional `sha256` an entry may carry, so an installed package
  described the registry format less fully than a checkout did.
* A malformed design or schema is refused by name. `read_config` returns whatever the
  parser produced, so an empty design file gave NULL and one written as a list gave a
  vector, and the first `$` on either reported a type rather than the file. A design
  without `name` got further: the base name for every artefact is built from the name
  and the language, so its stimuli, reports and experiments were written under the
  language alone, colliding silently with any other nameless design in that language.
  `run_all` now names the design a failure came from as well.
* `describe_stimuli`, `match_report` and `match_report_continuous` refuse a dimension
  or a grouping column the stimuli do not carry. A misspelt name returned a full
  descriptives table of missing values, and through `match_report` a comparisons row
  with a Cohen's *d* of zero, so a report on a selection of the user's own looked
  complete and described nothing. The pipeline filters its dimensions to the columns
  present, so no design is affected.
* The generated OpenSesame experiment waits as long for a response as the PsychoPy
  and jsPsych experiments generated beside it. The rendered event carries the window
  in seconds and the OpenSesame emitters converted it back with `as.integer()`, which
  truncates, so a `timeout_ms` of 1001 became 1000 there and stayed 1001 in the other
  two. The conversion now goes through the package's own rounder. The shipped
  paradigms use round windows, so no committed experiment changed.
* The datasheet the Shiny app produces describes the design the app hands over. The
  run used a rewritten copy of the design, with the lexicon and any item table
  resolved to absolute paths, so the `design_sha256` recorded in the datasheet inside
  the downloaded bundle was the checksum of a file that bundle does not carry, and
  'Materials source' named a directory on the machine that ran the app. Each input is
  now placed at the path the exported design records and the pipeline runs there.
* The realised-control chart in the Shiny app draws one labelled bar per comparison.
  The report carries one row per non-anchor condition per dimension, and the plot named
  every bar by its dimension alone, so a 2x2 design repeated each label three times
  with nothing saying which comparison a bar belonged to. The bars are grouped by
  condition with a legend, and the caption names the anchor they are measured against.
* The parity claim under the exported code depends on the method that ran. The panel
  printed 'The R and Python engines produce byte-identical stimuli and trial order
  from this configuration.' whatever was chosen, which the method chooser's own help
  text and the datasheet's 'Cross-engine determinism' line both deny for
  `mahalanobis` and `optimal`. Those two now get a sentence saying the engines select
  equivalent but not byte-identical stimuli.
* A factorial run with nothing to match on is refused. 'Match on' can be emptied, and
  the pipeline accepts `match_on: []` happily, so the run reported success over a set
  that was never matched on anything and a realised-control tab of large effects,
  which reads as a matching failure rather than as a design that asked for no
  matching.
* A condition bound the conditions table holds as text drops the factor it belongs to.
  `as.numeric` gave NA and a warning, and the design then carried `define_by` of two
  missing values as if that window had been asked for.
* Rows can be added to and removed from the Shiny app's conditions table. It offered
  cell editing and nothing else, so a design could hold exactly as many conditions as
  the chosen preset supplies, and a three-level factor, a fifth 2x2 cell or a preset
  row the user did not want meant editing the YAML by hand. 'Add condition' and
  'Remove selected' sit under the table.
* The 'Match on' chooser names its dimensions as the rest of the interface does. It
  listed the raw column names while the tolerance panel beside it uses the human
  labels the app already defines, and the Streamlit twin labels the same chooser.
* The chosen lexicon and the bundled item table are previewed before a run. The app
  showed a bare chooser and a sentence naming the example table, so the user committed
  to a run without seeing a row of the input. The realised-control plot also carries
  alt text now.
* Every edit to the Shiny app's conditions table lands in the column the user edited.
  The table is rendered without rownames, so the client reports a zero-based column
  index, while `DT::editData` was called at its default `rownames = TRUE` and read one
  column to the left: an edit to `dimension` overwrote the condition's name, an edit to
  `lower` overwrote `dimension`, and an edit to the name itself was dropped from the
  frame altogether. The app ran and exported the altered design without saying
  anything. The optional `lower2` and `upper2` columns are typed as numeric too, where
  three of the presets left them logical and the first edit of such a cell coerced the
  whole column to text.
* The Shiny app no longer crashes on Run when it is launched from outside the
  checkout. With no `corpora/derived/` above the working directory the lexicon chooser
  was rendered empty and silent, and pressing Run indexed that empty vector before the
  'Choose a lexicon first.' guard could be reached, so the user was shown Shiny's
  generic error. The chooser is now replaced by a notice naming the cause, and the
  guard does its job.
* A preset also sets the matched dimensions and the matching method that suit it, as
  the Streamlit app's presets already did. Filling the conditions table alone left
  'Match on' at its general default, so one click on 'Dense vs sparse neighbourhood'
  asked the engine to match on `n_density`, the dimension the preset manipulates, and
  on `old20`, which follows it closely. The run did not fail; it returned a much weaker
  manipulation with frequency and length uncontrolled.
* Every fixed-decimal number in the datasheet is rounded by lexsync's own rounder
  before it is formatted. A bare `%.2f` leaves the half-way case to the C library, and
  the two engines disagree there: `en_andrews_repro` stored a confidence bound of
  -0.465 and published it as [-0.46, 0.66] from this engine and [-0.47, 0.66] from
  Python, on the same machine. The Methods paragraph the vignettes invite users to
  paste into a paper used the same format, so a published sentence could differ by
  engine. Sixteen published numbers across seven designs move by one in the last
  decimal place shown; the stored values are unchanged.
* The TOST *p* in the realised-control table is written with `%g`. `as.character` gave
  `9e-04` where the Python engine gave `0.0009` for the same stored double, and nothing
  compared the two engines' datasheets to notice. Both engines now write one form, and
  the comparison is made: over the committed pair, and over a fresh sweep in the
  workflow.
* The committed datasheets publish checksums this repository reproduces. 28 of them
  recorded the sha256 of a CRLF copy of an input that `.gitattributes` checks out as
  LF, so a recipient who followed the datasheet's own instructions and recomputed the
  digest of `corpora/derived/en.csv` was told the materials had been altered. All 42
  datasheets are regenerated, and the suite now checks every path and digest a
  committed datasheet publishes against the files in the checkout.
* The neighbourhood and bigram dimensions are derived wherever the design asks for
  them, not for `match_on` alone: a design that filters on `old20`, defines a
  condition by `n_density` or takes either as a continuous predictor no longer stops
  on a lexicon that does not already carry the column. A filter on such a dimension is
  answered after the filters the lexicon can answer, so the derivation still runs on
  the pool.
* A generated experiment presents one counterbalancing list rather than all of them.
  The loop table carries every list, because one experiment file serves the whole
  study, and all three runners presented that file whole: under a Latin square each
  target was then shown once in every condition, often on adjacent trials. Each run
  now presents the list the participant is allocated, taken from `--participant` in
  the PsychoPy script, from the `?participant=` query in the jsPsych page and from
  OpenSesame's own subject number, and all three present the first list when no
  participant is given. The committed experiments are regenerated.
* `counterbalance.lists` above what the design can fill is an error. The factorial
  recipe deals item sets to lists round-robin, so more lists than item sets left the
  high-numbered lists empty while the datasheet still reported the number requested,
  and the Latin-square rotation repeats after as many lists as there are conditions,
  so a further list duplicated an earlier one. Both recipes now stop, with the message
  the Python engine gives. No shipped design asks for more lists than it can fill.
* Breaking change: a row missing one of the `match_on` dimensions is no longer
  selected. An unscoreable anchor has the same distance to every candidate, so the
  tie-break alone chose its counterpart, and `joint` and `optimal` would take a pair
  with no distance at all to reach `n`. The anchor condition and both pairwise
  subpools now drop such rows, as the matched conditions' tolerance windows already
  did. This is reachable through any `norms:` table that does not cover the whole
  lexicon. No shipped design has a hole on a matched dimension, so no committed
  artefact changed.
* A design that declares `conditions` but no `match_on` is an error. This engine read
  it as no dimensions at all, scored every candidate at distance zero and wrote a
  datasheet saying the items had been matched on nothing, while the Python engine died
  with a bare `KeyError`. Both now stop with the same message.
* `.exact_sum` returns `NA` on missing input instead of stopping with "missing value
  where TRUE/FALSE needed". The Python twin returns `NaN` there, so `matching: method:
  joint` over a partially covering norm table ran in one engine and failed in the
  other. `.exact_mean`, `.exact_var` and `.exact_sd` inherit the contract;
  `.exact_median` keeps its stated exception of dropping missing values first.
* Breaking change: a design that names a paradigm keeps that paradigm's
  counterbalancing recipe when it declares its own `events`. The recipe used to fall
  back to factorial whenever an `events` list was present, so
  `config/design_en_priming_jitter.yaml`, which names `priming` and adjusts two
  durations, dealt every target to each list twice, once related and once unrelated.
  It now rotates through the Latin square like the other priming designs, and its
  committed stimuli and experiments are regenerated. No other shipped design changes.
* The datasheet records the counterbalancing recipe that ran. It inferred the recipe
  from `items.source` while `counterbalance()` dispatched on the paradigm, so a
  table-sourced design could be recorded as a Latin-square rotation it never had;
  both now come from the same dispatch.
* The package now declares `Depends: R (>= 4.0.0)`. `tools::R_user_dir` does not
  exist before 4.0.0, and `round()`'s post-4.0 algorithm shapes artefact bytes, so an
  older R would fail obscurely or write different bytes without complaint.
* The published median goes through the exact reductions. `describe_stimuli()` was
  the one reduction still on `stats::median`, which averages the two middle values
  through `mean()`'s long-double accumulator while the Python engine reduced through
  numpy. Both engines now sort and take the exact middle, with `(a + b) / 2` in plain
  double arithmetic for even n, and regenerating every design moved no byte.
  *Reproducibility and parity* claimed that every reduction shared one
  compensated-summation algorithm,
  which the median never did, and now describes the sort-and-middle rule beside it.
* The dead half of the two-shortest-forms CSV guard now fires. Between 2^49 and
  1e15 two one-decimal strings can round-trip to the same double, and the R check
  derived its digit count from a 15-digit format that never shows a fractional digit
  there, so R accepted values (844424930131968.2 among them) that the Python writer
  refused. R now refuses exactly the same values, and the change only adds refusals.
* A condition without `define_by` selects identically in both engines. This engine
  always fell back to the whole pool. The Python engine crashed with a bare KeyError on
  the same design and now mirrors the fallback, pinned by twin tests.
* A pair design's tolerance-window relaxation reaches the run log and datasheet.
  The continuous-pairs selector's re-expansion dropped the audit in both engines, so a
  relaxed window left no trace outside the console. No shipped pair design relaxes, so
  no committed artefact changed.
* `INTER_TRIGGER_S` is substituted through `%.17g` like its neighbours in the
  generated PsychoPy script. It used `as.character()`, whose rendering of a
  non-integer quotient differs from Python's `str()`. The shipped default still renders
  "0.01", so no committed experiment byte moved.
* The hash keys behind trial order, list balancing and jitter are normalised to UTF-8
  bytes in every locale. Wrapping the pasted key in `enc2utf8()` left a latin1-marked
  or unmarked condition label hashing its escape text under a C locale, so `hash_unit()`
  and the trial order differed from the Python engine's there; every character
  component is now normalised before the key is assembled, and the tests pin the
  Python digests for all three encoding marks under the C locale.
* YAML is read as UTF-8 whatever the session locale. `yaml::read_yaml()` re-encodes
  the file through the native encoding, so under a C locale `list_corpora()` and
  `fetch_corpus()` failed on the bundled registry's accented citation and
  `read_config()` silently dropped every key after an accented label. The readers now
  take the bytes as UTF-8 and return UTF-8-marked strings.
* The command-line wrapper reports which copy of the package it loaded.
  `R_workflow/run_pipeline.R` prefers an installed lexsync over the edited sources, so
  edits silently did nothing until a reinstall. It now states the loaded copy and the
  remedy on stderr at startup.
* The Shiny app offers the categorisation paradigm, wired to the bundled
  `items/categorisation_en.csv` as priming and self-paced reading are. The package
  registers five paradigms while the chooser listed four, and the test that claimed the
  chooser was complete compared against a written-out list rather than
  `names(PARADIGMS)`.
* The Shiny app writes its design YAML with LF endings through a binary connection
  (the datasheet hashes that file into `design_sha256`, which must not depend on the
  operating system), and its parity caption now matches the keyed-hash guarantee: the
  engines produce byte-identical stimuli and trial order, where the caption used to
  promise only the stimuli. The
  Python engine's twin fixes land in the same release: its writer refuses 16-digit
  integer columns as this engine always has, its scalar rounder passes an overflowing
  scale through, and `run_pipeline(verbose = FALSE)` keeps its console silent.
* A selection that cannot honour `n_per_condition` is now an error. Every selector
  used to clip the request to the available pool and said so at most
  through a verbose message, while the datasheet and the generated Methods text kept
  stating the requested n. The new `matching: shortfall` policy defaults to `error`,
  and `allow` accepts the shrink. Its sibling `matching: on_insufficient_tolerance` (default
  `relax`) can likewise turn the silent tolerance-window widening into a refusal, and a
  relaxation that does happen is now recorded in the run log and the datasheet
  (`selection.window_relaxations`), where before it was only narrated to the console. No
  committed design experiences either condition.
* `joint` and `optimal` matching can no longer select the same word twice. With
  overlapping condition windows a word could be paired with itself at zero cost, or
  mirrored across two sets, appearing in both conditions. Both matchers now track used
  words as the anchored matcher always has, and every matcher asserts its output holds
  each word at most once. Every committed design has disjoint conditions, and those
  select identically, byte for byte.
* The item-table loader refuses missing cells in both engines. A blank `condition`
  reached Python's hash-key guard as the string "nan" and passed the very check built
  to refuse it, a blank `item` cell turned numeric identifiers into "1.0", and R failed
  on the same table with a bare "missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed". Missingness is
  now checked before any coercion, `item` is read as text, empties after trimming and
  duplicated item-and-condition rows are refused, and both engines say the same thing.
* Cohen's d no longer reports perfect balance for two unequal constant vectors. The
  standardised difference is undefined when the pooled SD is zero and the means differ,
  so it is now reported as missing. The old 0 with CI [0, 0] contradicted the TOST
  verdict on the same row.
* The datasheet's Methods prose follows the recorded verdicts. The claim of being
  "within the 0.5-SD equivalence bound" was printed for any controlled dimension with a
  confidence interval, even where the datasheet's own JSON recorded `equivalent: false`.
  The sentence is now conditional on the stored verdicts, prints the signed worst
  difference and the configurable bound, and the analysis note names the suggested
  formula as `lme4` syntax, where it used to imply that `statsmodels` accepts it. The
  datasheet also gains the SHA-256 of the design and schema, the pairwise matchers'
  candidate cap and whether it fired, the equivalence bound tested against, and the
  `yaml`, `stringi` and operating-system entries the environment record omitted.
* A `continuous` block now works over a supplied pool, and two silent table-mode gaps
  are refusals. `source: pool` reaches the continuous selector (it previously fell
  through to the conditions matcher and crashed). A continuous table without `members`
  is an error now, as is `pool_filters` on a plain table design, where each used to do
  nothing silently while the provenance recorded otherwise. Misspelt `pool_filters` or
  `define_by` columns, duplicate condition names, reversed or non-finite ranges,
  negative tolerances and non-integer n are likewise refusals now.
* Selection-path rounding goes through the shared decimal rule (`.round_dp` and a
  new vectorised numpy twin), replacing a pairing of R's `round()` with numpy's, two
  rounders the project measured to disagree at boundaries. Regenerating all 21 designs
  moved no stimulus, report or experiment byte. A custom norm named in `match_on` now
  also reaches the descriptives, comparisons and realised-control record, which
  previously listed only the built-in dimensions.
* A design file could execute code on the machine that ran it. A design is meant to
  be shared, and the recipient runs it and then opens the generated PsychoPy script,
  OpenSesame experiment or jsPsych page. Stimulus text was always safe: it travels in
  the loop-table CSV the experiment reads at run time. Design *metadata* was not. The
  name, language label, font, parallel-port address and the column names on jitter and
  feedback events were substituted straight into code and markup positions, so a quote
  or an angle bracket there stopped being text and became syntax, and a crafted design
  could run arbitrary code on a lab machine or in the origin of a hosted browser study.
  Both engines now validate these values, under one rule that leaves every legitimate
  value byte-identical. A port address must be an address, a column name must be an
  identifier, and a stated `language_tag` is shape-checked before it is used. Escaping
  them correctly would have taken three rules per engine.
  `.pyq()` escapes newlines now as well: an `.osexp` is line-oriented, so a raw
  newline closed the inline-script block and let the rest of the value start a new
  top-level item. Pinned by `test-injection.R`. No generated artefact changed.
  Adversarially attacking that fix then found four ways through it, all now closed and
  pinned. The largest: a response event's `keys` were joined into OpenSesame's `set
  allowed_responses "a;b"` with no validation at all, and that is one line of a
  line-oriented format, so a key holding a double quote closed the string, a newline
  ended the line, and the rest of the value became new top-level items in the
  experiment, including an `inline_script` whose body OpenSesame runs. Keys are
  validated now. The shape guards were also anchored with `$`, which in both Python's
  `re` and R's PCRE matches just before a final newline, so a port address ending in one
  passed the check. They are anchored at end-of-string now. A scalar `keys: space` or
  `blocks: practice` was iterated character by character in Python and kept whole in R,
  so one design gave two different allowed-response lists and a block-restricted event
  ran everywhere in one engine and nowhere in the other. And R's HTML escape did not
  cover U+2028/U+2029, which end a line in JavaScript but are not ASCII controls: Python
  escaped them, R did not, so the same design produced different bytes and R's
  `<script>` was a syntax error before ES2019.
* A browser experiment could score a feedback screen against the previous trial's
  keypress. The jsPsych feedback screen looked up 'the last row marked scoreable',
  which is that trial's response only when the trial has one. An event may be restricted
  to a block, so a design running the response event in one block and feedback in another
  leaves a trial with no response row of its own, and the screen then reported a verdict
  computed from an earlier trial's key. Each trial's rows now carry its own identifier and
  the screen matches on it. The generated HTML changed for all 21 designs. No stimulus
  selection changed.
* A large number in a user's own column was written differently by the two engines.
  `write_csv_utf8()` reproduced readr's format for small magnitudes and left the top end
  alone, since nothing lexsync computes reaches it. Nothing lexsync computes does. A
  joined norm table, a supplied pool or an item table carries whatever columns the user
  has, and those go straight into the stimuli CSV, so the guarantee held for the shipped
  designs and failed silently for the user's own data. readr's layout above 1e15 could not
  be reproduced in Python, which writes 1.5e16 as `15e15`, the largest double as
  `17976931348623157e292`, and the double nearest 5e22 as `4.9999999999999996e+22`. Both
  engines now refuse such a value and name the column. One engine accepting it would
  leave the two writing different bytes. A value with two equally short decimal forms is
  refused for the same reason. Everything verified to render identically, across 465
  values compared against readr's own output, writes as before.
* A generated OpenSesame experiment with a `feedback` event or a `blocks:` restriction
  would not run. The emitter wrote `unicode(...)`, a Python 2 builtin that
  OpenSesame's Python 3 inline workspace does not provide, so the experiment died with
  `NameError` on the first trial. It also passed `None` as a `var.get()` default, which
  OpenSesame cannot distinguish from no default, so it raises where it should return.
  Both are fixed, both spellings are now pinned by a test, and a `feedback` event with
  no preceding `response` or `question` is refused at generation time. Left to run time,
  that one design error would surface as three different failures, one per target.
* Reported statistics are rounded by an arithmetic definition both engines compute
  identically, because no pairing of built-ins agreed. Measured over 210,000 values,
  including every three-decimal halfway case in range, R's `round()` disagrees with
  Python's builtin, Python's builtin disagrees with numpy's, and even R's
  `sprintf("%.3f")` disagrees with Python's `"%.3f"` on 274 of them. Some values move by
  one in the last published digit. No selection changes.
* A hash-key component that cannot be rendered identically in both engines is now
  refused rather than hashed. A blank `condition` cell, a routine data error neither
  reader rejects, rendered `"NA"` in R and `"nan"` in Python, so the two engines
  produced different trial orders from the same design, reproducibly and with nothing to
  signal it. Booleans get a pinned spelling and are still accepted.
* The overlap-cap centroid in the `joint` and `optimal` matchers goes through the
  compensated reduction. The cap does fire on shipped designs, so it decides which
  candidates reach matching. It was verified to change no design's selection.
* `R CMD check --as-cran` is clean: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 1 note (the standard
  new-submission note). Fixed on the way: three undocumented arguments on
  `select_continuous_stimuli()`, an unqualified `utils::head()`, and the package's only
  example, which called an unexported function from inside `\dontrun{}` and so could
  never have worked if a user copied it. The package now has executable, offline
  examples, and `cran-comments.md` no longer misstates the check result.
* Three factual corrections. The SUBTLEX-PT registry entry cited a DOI that resolves to
  an unrelated psychometrics paper. The matching vignette put Zipf 7 at a thousand
  occurrences per million where the correct figure is ten thousand, contradicting its
  own lower anchor.
  A design comment attributed '840-prime materials' to Rastle et al. (2004), a figure
  that appears nowhere in that paper.
* The vignettes and the reference state what the package does, leaving what it used to
  do to this file. The matching vignette said `verbose = TRUE` was the only report of a
  relaxed tolerance window, which the `audit` attribute, the run log and the datasheet
  have since answered, and said an unknown `pool_filters` column is skipped silently,
  which is true of a direct `build_pool()` call but not of `run_pipeline()`.
  `build_datasheet()`'s `report` argument is the list `match_report()` returns rather
  than a data frame, and it is supplied for generated items and pair-keyed tables too;
  `fetch_corpus()` prints the citation when the download completes rather than recording
  it.
* A design may declare `practice:` and `fillers:` item tables. Those trials are
  presented but not analysed, so the stimuli file and the
  reports are written from the main rows while the generated experiments run every
  trial. Practice comes first. Fillers are interleaved with the main trials, because a
  block of fillers at the end is not a filler but a second block a participant can tell
  apart. A design declaring neither is unaffected, down to not gaining a `block` column.
* A `feedback` trial event, and a `blocks:` key that restricts any event to named
  blocks. Together these confine feedback to practice, which is the usual arrangement:
  feedback teaches the mapping, and would contaminate the reaction times it is
  measuring. Implemented for PsychoPy, OpenSesame and jsPsych alike. The
  PsychoPy runner now returns the pressed key so it can be scored, and each runner pauses
  at a block boundary.
* The Python engine embedded a bare `NaN` in the generated jsPsych experiment where a
  trial had no value for a field another block supplies (a main-block trial in a design
  whose practice items carry an `answer`). That is not valid JSON, and the R engine
  dropped the key instead, so the two engines' experiments differed. Both now drop it.
* The generated artefacts were not byte-identical across the engines, and the parity
  test could not see it. It read both CSVs back with a parser and compared the values,
  under which `1` and `1.0` are the same number. Thirteen of the 18 shipped designs differed
  byte for byte while the gate stayed green. Three differences were serialisation (a
  whole number written `1` and `1.0`, a boolean written `FALSE` and `False`, a small
  value written `9e-4` and `0.0009`) and one was not: two reported means differed in the
  last decimal published, because numpy sums pairwise and R's `mean()` does not. Every
  reduction in the package now uses one compensated-summation algorithm written out in
  both engines, whose agreement follows from IEEE-754 and no longer from measurement.
  The writers agree on every value, and the artefacts are now compared as bytes. No R
  golden moved, because R's two-pass mean was already the correctly-rounded one.
* A response key coded `f` was silently turned into `FALSE`. `readr` reads a column
  whose values are all `f`, `t`, `T` or `F` as logical, while pandas keeps the string, so
  an item table using the commonest two-choice key pair had its correct answer corrupted
  in one engine. Item tables now read the condition label and the paradigm's presented
  fields as text in both engines.
* `jsonlite`'s default of four digits was truncating the datasheet: a design declaring
  `tolerance_k: 0.1111111111111111` had it recorded as `0.1111`, which does not reproduce
  the run the record exists to describe. The JSON is now written at full display
  precision, and the Python engine writes the same precision.
* New paradigm `categorisation`: a category cue, then the word to judge against it, with
  `answer` holding the correct response key so the data are scoreable. Counterbalanced by
  Latin-square rotation, so a participant never sees the same target twice.
* `counterbalance.optimise` (off by default) assigns item sets to lists so the lists are
  equated on the declared dimensions, where the old deal went by set rank. The search is
  a deterministic integer descent with a keyed-hash tie-break, so it uses no random
  number generator and both engines produce the same assignment. `balance_lists()` is
  exported.
* New item source `pool`: a supplied word list goes through the matcher without having
  to masquerade as a corpus lexicon. `load_pool()` is exported. The neighbourhood
  dimensions are computed against the lexicon's words, because a word's neighbours are
  its neighbours in the language.
* A design may name norm tables in a `norms:` block. They are joined onto the
  lexicon before the candidate pool is built, so a semantic dimension the corpus
  does not carry (concreteness, age of acquisition, valence) can be filtered on,
  matched on or spanned like any other. No norm data is bundled. Every joined table
  is recorded in the materials datasheet with its checksum and its per-column
  coverage, because a norm table can supply the very variable a design manipulates.
* Datasheet version 1.1. It adds `materials_source$norms` and, for a pair-keyed
  design, a `relational` block naming the members, the pair count, the member
  lexicon and its checksum, and the member-level dimensions separately from the
  relational ones. `selection$cross_engine` no longer reports
  "n/a (user-supplied items)" for a pair-keyed continuous design: that design does
  perform a selection, and it is byte-identical across engines.
* `merge_norms()` returns the lexicon with the norm columns appended, in the
  lexicon's own row *and column* order. It previously used `merge()`, which hoists
  the join column to position 1 where pandas keeps the left frame's order, so the
  two engines disagreed on column order whenever `on` was not already first. The
  join key is now case- and whitespace-folded on the lexicon's side too, where only
  the norm table's was folded before: a lexicon holding `Dog` used to match nothing and
  leave an all-`NA` dimension. A norm column whose name already exists on the lexicon
  is now an error. Renaming it to `frequency.x` / `frequency.y`, as `merge()` did, left
  the matched dimension under a name nothing looks for.
* `write_datasheet()` and `write_run_log()` now write LF on every platform. They
  used a text-mode connection, so on Windows the datasheet, its Markdown rendering
  and the Markdown run log came out CRLF while the Python engine's twins were LF.
  The datasheet is the provenance record. Its bytes no longer depend on the machine
  that built it.
* `add_pair_overlap()` and `resolve_trial_timing()` are now exported in fact as well as
  in the documentation. Both were marked for export and documented, but the `NAMESPACE`
  had not been regenerated, so `library(lexsync)` did not make them available.
* The materials datasheet now reports the candidate-pool size per condition
  (selection transparency, making item-selection bias auditable) and a suggested
  crossed mixed-model formula that guards against the language-as-fixed-effect
  fallacy.
* Browser (jsPsych) experiments gain a welcome/instructions screen, per-row item
  metadata (condition, item id, list), and a completion screen that saves the
  collected data as a CSV download.
* The realised-control report and datasheet gain a variance ratio per dimension,
  a distributional balance check that complements Cohen's d and TOST.
* Wuggy-style subsyllabic pseudoword generation (opt-in `items.generation.method:
  subsyllabic`): whole onset/nucleus/coda constituents are swapped for attested
  same-role, same-length alternatives, preserving syllabic structure and length.
  Byte-identical across engines, and the default letter-substitution generator is
  unchanged.
* Continuous (non-dichotomised) design mode: declare a `continuous` block and
  `select_continuous_stimuli()` spans a predictor's range evenly while holding the
  controls near-constant, with predictor-control correlations and a regression
  suggested-model in the datasheet. Byte-identical across the R and Python engines.
* Two new matching methods: `mahalanobis` (a covariance-aware distance that
  down-weights correlated dimensions) and `optimal` (a globally optimal assignment
  for two-condition designs, using the suggested `clue` package). Unlike the
  default methods, these use a covariance inverse and an assignment solver, so the
  R and Python engines agree closely but not byte-for-byte on them.
* An unknown `matching.method`, and a candidate pool too small for the requested
  `n_per_condition`, now raise an actionable error. Each used to fall back silently,
  to a default method or to a short set. The Python engine raises the
  same message, and code that relied on the old fallback will now stop.
* `stringi` is a new hard dependency (Imports). The canonical word key is
  case-folded with ICU at the root locale, so the key no longer depends on the
  machine's locale and matches the Python engine byte for byte. `shiny`, `bslib`,
  `DT` and `zip` are new Suggests, for the Shiny app.
* Ten functions are newly exported, matching the Python package's public surface:
  `PARADIGMS`, `build_datasheet()`, `build_lexdec_stimuli()`,
  `count_syllables()`, `generate_pseudowords()`, `make_pseudoword()`,
  `methods_paragraph()`, `required_fields()`, `resolve_events()` and
  `write_datasheet()`.
* `tost_equiv()` now defaults to `bound_d = 0.5`, the value the Python engine
  already used. The R default was 0.4, so the equivalence bound is wider and a
  comparison is easier to declare equivalent. Reported verdicts can change for the
  same data.
* `describe_stimuli()` now orders rows by each group's first appearance, matching
  pandas. This changes the row order of generated descriptives.
* OpenSesame experiments now present trials in the seeded counterbalanced order.
  The order was previously randomised again at run time, so what ran was not what
  the pipeline generated and recorded.
* Breaking change: trial order within each counterbalancing list now comes from
  a seeded, keyed-hash shuffle shared with the Python engine. Each row is ranked
  by the SHA-256 digest of `seed|replicate|list|set|condition`, a tuple that
  identifies the trial uniquely under either counterbalancing recipe, so the
  permutation is a pure function of the design: byte-identical from both engines
  on any platform, and different for every seed. Previously the order was drawn
  from `sample()`, which could never match numpy's generator for the same seed,
  so the trial lists were the one engine-specific artefact. All 75 generated
  experiment files across the 15 designs bundled at the time are now byte-identical across
  the engines, and the parity gate now compares the `trial` column of the
  stimuli CSVs. Stimulus selection, pairing and lists are unchanged, but every
  design's trial order changes relative to the previous artefacts. The package
  no longer uses R's random-number generator at all, so a seeded run cannot
  perturb the calling script's random stream and there is no RNG state to save
  or restore.
* `merge_norms()` preserves the lexicon's row order, and `participant_table()`
  crosses factors in `expand.grid()` order in both engines.
* Datasheets record the tolerance windows and pseudoword generator that ran, filter
  dimensions as the Python engine does, and report the installed package version they
  were built by.
* `match_stimuli()` raises where it used to re-pick an already-used row, when a
  relaxed window re-admits candidates missing a matched dimension. Such a
  candidate has no defined distance and is never assigned, yet it still counted
  towards the pool-size guard. An NA-depleted pool could therefore pass the guard
  and go on to emit the same word in several sets.
* `match_stimuli()` and `select_continuous_stimuli()` no longer select an all-NA
  row when the tolerance window is NA (an anchor of a single item gives `sd = NA`).
  An undecided comparison now resolves to `FALSE`, as it does in Python, so the
  window is relaxed and a real word is selected.
* The generated PsychoPy script, OpenSesame experiment and jsPsych page are now
  byte-identical to the Python engine's, trial lists included (see the keyed-hash
  shuffle entry above).
* Selected stimuli are unchanged for all 15 designs bundled at the time.
* Every vignette now turns console colour off and fixes the console width while it
  renders. pkgdown passes the calling terminal's colour support into its build
  subprocess, so a coloured message or error would otherwise reach the reader as
  escape sequences in the middle of the text.
* See the top-level `CHANGELOG.md` for the full, cross-language history and the
  planned methodological roadmap.

# lexsync 0.1.0

* First release: multilingual corpus access, parallel multidimensional matching,
  counterbalancing, item resampling, deterministic pseudoword generation, and
  generation of hardware-timed PsychoPy, OpenSesame and jsPsych experiments. The
  R and Python engines select byte-identical stimuli, and every run ships a
  materials datasheet (provenance, checksums, realised control) and a
  pre-registration template.
