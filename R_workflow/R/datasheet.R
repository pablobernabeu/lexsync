# datasheet.R -- materials datasheet and pre-registration template. A machine- and
# human-readable provenance record for a design: where the items came from, how
# they were selected and matched, the realised control, how they were
# counterbalanced, and the seeds, versions and checksums needed to reproduce them
# exactly. The shareable materials record whose scarcity motivates lexsync
# (Bochynska et al., 2023; Roettger, 2019). Mirrors datasheet.py.

# 1.1 added `materials_source$norms` (the design's joined norm tables, with their
# checksums and per-column coverage) and, for a pair-keyed design, a `relational`
# block plus an honest `selection$cross_engine`. Both were required by the rule that
# anything affecting item selection is recorded here: a norm table can carry the
# manipulated variable itself, and the pair path performs a real selection that the
# record used to describe as "n/a (user-supplied items)".

# dimensions are separated from the relational ones because they are different kinds

#' @param stimuli The selected stimulus data frame.
#' @param source_path Path of the lexicon or item table the stimuli came from.

#' @param candidate_pool Optional list of per-condition candidate-pool sizes
#'   (`list(condition, n_candidates)`) recording how many items satisfied each
#'   condition's window before matching; reported for selection transparency.
#' @param norms Optional list of norm-table provenance records, from the design's
#'   `norms:` block (see the pipeline). Each names a file, its sha256, the join key
#'   and the per-column coverage. Recorded because a norm table can supply the very

#' @param balance Optional balance-optimiser report, from [balance_lists()].
#'   Recorded because it decides which items each participant sees.

#' @param design_path,schema_path Optional paths of the design and schema files
#'   the run read; when given, their sha256 checksums complete the
#'   reproducibility record, because those two files decide everything the seed
#'   does not.

#'   entries are recorded because a relaxed window changes what "matched" means
#'   for that condition.
