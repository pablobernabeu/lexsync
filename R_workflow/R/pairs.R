# pairs.R -- the pair-keyed item model: word-level norms joined onto each member of
# a prime-target pair, and continuous selection over pairs rather than words.
#
# Before this, a design could have matching or its own item table but never both:
# the continuous selector consumed a word pool while `items.source: table` bypassed
# selection entirely. A relational design needs both at once, because its predictor
# (distributional similarity, associative strength) is a property of the pair while
# its controls (frequency, length) are properties of each member.
#
# Mirrors python_workflow/src/lexsync/pairs.py.

# Column names a member may not take. The engines read all of these with `$`, and
# R's `$` partial-matches on a data frame, so a joined `word.frequency` with no bare
# `word` present would make the selector's tie-break silently sort by it while the
# Python engine raised KeyError. Rejecting the name is cheaper than defending every
# read site. Must list the same names as pairs.py.
