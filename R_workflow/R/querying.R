#' Lower-case a character vector under the Unicode default case mapping
#'
#' Base R's `tolower()` hands case mapping to the C library, so it is both
#' locale- and platform-dependent (see `?chartr`): under a C or 8-bit locale it
#' leaves accented capitals uncased, and even under a UTF-8 locale it applies
#' only the simple mappings, rendering Greek final sigma as U+03C3 and dropping
#' the dot of U+0130. Python's `str.lower()` always applies the Unicode default
#' *full* mapping, giving U+03C2 and i + U+0307 respectively. `word` is the
#' canonical key behind every byte-order tie-break, so the engines must fold
#' case identically; pinning ICU to the root locale ("und") reproduces Python's
#' mapping exactly and removes the ambient locale from the result.
#'

#' behind every byte-order tie-break, so a lexicon padded with any of those

#' them. The join is deterministic and identical across engines.
#'
#' The result is the lexicon itself with the norm columns appended, and the key is
#' looked up positionally rather than through `merge()`. That is what makes the two
#' engines agree structurally rather than by repair afterwards, because `merge()`
#' and `pandas.merge` were measured to diverge in three ways, each of them silent:
#' R hoists the `by` column to position 1 while pandas keeps the left frame's
#' order, so the column order differed whenever `on` was not already first; R
#' disambiguates a colliding column name with `.x`/`.y` and pandas with `_x`/`_y`,
#' and either way a dimension the design matches on disappears under a name
#' nothing looks for; and `merge(sort = FALSE)` leaves the row order unspecified
#' rather than keeping x's. A positional lookup has none of those degrees of
#' freedom: the output is the input plus columns, in both engines. A colliding
#' name is now an error instead.
#'
#' The key is trimmed and case-folded on *both* sides. Only the norm table's side
#' was normalised before, so a lexicon holding `Dog` matched nothing and the design
#' carried on with an all-`NA` dimension -- and because both engines agreed on that
#' wrong answer, no parity test could have caught it. The lexicon's own spelling is

# ---- The design's `norms:` block --------------------------------------------

# a semantic dimension lexsync does not compute:
#
#   norms:
#     - path: norms/en_concreteness.csv
#       on: word                  # optional join key, default 'word'
#       columns: [concreteness]   # optional; default every column but the key
#
# The join itself is merge_norms(). What this adds is provenance, and that is not a
# nicety: a norm table can carry the very variable a design manipulates, so a
# datasheet that did not name the file and its checksum would describe a selection
# over columns whose origin is recorded nowhere. The loader hands the records back
# for build_datasheet() to write down.
#
# Coverage is recorded per column rather than per file, because one table can cover a
# dimension well and another badly, and an unmatched row becomes an NA that the
# tolerance windows then drop from the pool without saying so.

# YAML gives a sequence of mappings as an unnamed list of named lists, and a single
# bare mapping as one named list. Writing one entry as a bare mapping is the obvious
# thing to do, so accept both shapes. `names()` of an unnamed list is NULL and
