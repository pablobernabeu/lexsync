# ---- Balance-aware list assignment (counterbalance.optimise) ----------------
#
# The factorial recipe deals item sets to lists by rank: set 1 to list 1, set 2 to
# list 2, and so on. That is reproducible but arbitrary with respect to the items
# themselves, so one list can end up holding systematically shorter or more frequent
# words than another. Where lists are given to different participants, that
# difference is confounded with the between-subjects factor.
#
# `counterbalance.optimise: true` searches for an assignment whose lists match on the
# declared dimensions instead. It is off by default: switching it on changes which
# items a participant sees, so it must be an explicit choice rather than something
# that happens to a design on upgrade.
#
# The search obeys the package's two hard rules, and both shape the code below more
# than is obvious.
#
# No RNG. The order of the search and every tie in it is decided by the seeded keyed
# hash already used for trial order, so the result is a pure function of the design.
#
# An ALL-INTEGER objective. This is not fastidiousness. Cohen's d computed in the two
# engines was measured to differ by about 3e-16 on average, which at nine decimal
# places leaves roughly a one-in-three chance over a full run that a comparison of
# two candidate swaps resolves differently in R than in Python -- and the failure is
# silent and total, different words rather than different last bits. So the values
# are quantised to integers ONCE, and the search then uses only +, -, * and
# comparison, all of which are exact on integers held in doubles below 2^53. There is
# no division anywhere in the objective.

# Milli-units of a dimension's own mean, the scale every dimension is quantised to.
# Expressing all dimensions in one unit is what lets their imbalances be added
# without a per-dimension float weight: a word's length and its Zipf frequency differ
# by orders of magnitude in raw units, and summing raw deviations would silently
# optimise almost entirely for whichever dimension has the larger numbers.
#
# The constant is 1000 times the 100 that `unit` already carries (see .quantise_dim),
# so a value at the dimension's mean quantises to 1000. That factor is not cosmetic:
# at 1000 here, a value at the mean quantised to 10, which left only about ten
# distinguishable levels across a dimension's whole range, and imbalances smaller than
# a tenth of the mean were invisible to the objective. The search then traded away a
# dimension it could not see in order to improve one it could.
.BALANCE_UNIT_SCALE <- 100000L

# Guard on the objective's magnitude. The arithmetic is exact only while every
# intermediate stays below 2^53; past that a sum would round and the two engines
# could disagree. Nothing near this is reachable with realistic designs (the bound is
# some four orders of magnitude above a 200-set, six-dimension design), so this is a
# tripwire rather than a limit, and it fails loudly instead of quietly rounding.

# rounding mode is involved. `round()` would have agreed on every case measured, but
# truncation removes the question rather than answering it.
#

#'
