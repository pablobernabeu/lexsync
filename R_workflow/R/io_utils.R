# the engines in the last decimal place the descriptives publish, 1.448 from R against
# 1.447 from numpy, because R's mean() uses a two-pass long-double algorithm while
# numpy sums pairwise, and the true value happened to sit on a rounding boundary.
# Summing 20000 identical doubles was measured to give three different answers across
# R's sum(), math.fsum, numpy's pairwise sum and a naive loop, so no language's
# built-in reduction can be relied on for a cross-engine artefact.
#
# Neumaier compensated summation is used instead, written out in plain double
# arithmetic in both engines. Every operation is +, -, abs or a comparison, and
# IEEE-754 requires + and - to be correctly rounded, so the two engines execute the
# same sequence of exactly-specified operations and cannot disagree. That is an

# builtin disagrees with numpy's round(), and even R's sprintf("%.3f") disagrees with
# Python's "%.3f" on 274 of them, because R's delegates to the platform C library while
# Python's is correctly rounded. No value rounded for an artefact can safely be handed
# to any language's own rounder.
#
# This one is defined by its arithmetic instead: scale, truncate toward zero, then step
# away from zero when the remainder reaches a half. Every operation is *, -, /, trunc,
# abs or a comparison, all of which IEEE-754 either mandates correctly rounded or makes
# exact, so both engines compute the same double from the same input by construction.
#
# It rounds the SCALED double. For a tie that is not exactly representable, the true
# decimal value would give a different answer, so this is a choice the package makes
# and arithmetic does not force. It is the same trade-off the balance optimiser's
# quantisation already makes, and it is the right way
# round: reproducible across engines matters more here than agreeing with what a
# calculator would say about a value that was never exactly a half.

#' Validate a metadata value interpolated into generated code or markup

#' A design's name, language label and font are not stimuli. They do not travel in the
#' loop table the experiment reads at run time; they are substituted straight into the
#' PsychoPy script, the OpenSesame inline Python and the jsPsych HTML, so a quote or an
#' angle bracket there stops being text and becomes syntax. A design file is meant to be
#' shared and re-run by someone else, which is what makes an unvalidated one an
#' executable payload as much as a configuration.
#'
#' Refusing beats escaping. Escaping correctly would mean three different escapes for
#' three targets in two engines, six places to get subtly wrong, and it would change the
#' bytes the two engines write; refusing is one rule that leaves every legitimate value
#' ("en_lexdec", "english", "Courier New", "SimHei") byte-identical. Mirrors the Python
