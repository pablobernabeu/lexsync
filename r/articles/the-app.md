# The app

Not every design has to be written as code. The repository carries a
Shiny front-end over this package which drives the whole workflow
through a browser tab, from choosing a paradigm to downloading the
stimuli, the realised-control report and the materials datasheet. It is
a front-end and nothing more. Every number it shows is produced by the
installed `lexsync` package rather than by a re-implementation, and the
design it assembles is an ordinary YAML file that you can save, share
and run from a script afterwards.

This article describes the app rather than running it, since the app
needs a live server, so the code below is shown but not evaluated.

## Launching it

The app is not part of the package. It lives in the repository, under
`apps/r_shiny`, beside the corpora and the example item tables that it
reads, so start from a clone rather than from an installed package
alone. The interface needs shiny, bslib and DT, and the download button
needs zip. All four are listed in the package’s `Suggests`.

``` r

install.packages(c("shiny", "bslib", "DT", "zip"))
shiny::runApp("apps/r_shiny", port = 8502)
```

Run that from the root of the clone. The app looks for
`corpora/derived/` in the working directory and then in the two
directories above it, and it finds the example item tables under
`items/` the same way, so a launch from somewhere else leaves it with no
lexicon to offer. It opens at <http://127.0.0.1:8502>.

The repository also carries a launcher for the terminal, which takes an
optional port and is what a container or a headless session should use.

``` sh
Rscript apps/r_shiny/run.R          # 8502 unless a port is given
Rscript apps/r_shiny/run.R 8600
```

The launcher fixes the host and the port and never opens a browser
itself. A server started with an auto-launched browser or an unbound
port can exit the moment it is backgrounded, which is the usual reason
an app appears not to stay up in an automated environment.

## The sidebar

The sidebar holds what every design needs whatever its paradigm.
‘Paradigm’ chooses between a factorial word contrast drawn from a
corpus, lexical decision with generated pseudowords, priming and
self-paced reading, the last two reading prepared items from a table.
‘Design name’ and ‘Language label’ become the slug that every written
file is named after, exactly as in a design file, so `my_design` plus
`english` gives `my_design_english_stimuli_R.csv` and its companions.
‘Stimulus font’ overrides the presentation font, which matters for a
non-Latin script, and it reaches the design only when it differs from
the `Courier New` default, leaving the schema in charge otherwise.

Under those the sidebar prints the version of lexsync that is running,
with the reminder that the app runs the installed package. If that line
disagrees with the version you expect, the app is reading a different
install.

## Describing the design

The main panel changes with the paradigm, since a corpus-matched
contrast and a prepared item table need different things.

### A factorial word contrast

‘Lexicon’ lists the derived corpora the clone holds under
`corpora/derived/`, which are English, Spanish, a Spanish lexicon
carrying grammatical gender, and Mandarin Chinese. Two sliders then
narrow the lexicon to the candidate pool the design will consider at
all, one for length in letters or characters and one for frequency in
Zipf. They are the design’s `pool_filters`, and they are a real step
rather than a formality, because matching never re-reads them.

The conditions are an editable table. Each row names a condition and
carves it out of the pool, either by a numeric window through the
`dimension`, `lower` and `upper` columns or by a set of comma-separated
values through `categories`, which is what a categorical column such as
the gender of the Spanish lexicon needs. The optional `dimension2`,
`lower2` and `upper2` columns add a second factor to the same row, so
one row can define a full cell of a 2 × 2. Three presets fill the table
in one click, a high versus low frequency contrast, a dense versus
sparse neighbourhood contrast and a 2 × 2 of frequency by neighbourhood,
and every cell stays editable afterwards, so a preset is a starting
point rather than a constraint.

Below the table sit the choices that govern the match itself. ‘Items per
condition’ sets how many stimuli each condition should hold. ‘Matching
method’ offers the four the engine implements, `standardised_euclidean`,
`joint`, `mahalanobis` and `optimal`. ‘Resampled disjoint sets’ draws
several matched sets that share no item, which is what lets items be
treated as a random factor, and zero switches it off. ‘Match on’ picks
the dimensions to equate across conditions, from length, frequency,
neighbourhood N, OLD20, syllable count and bigram frequency.
‘Counterbalancing lists’ sets how many lists the items are rotated
across.

The advanced panel underneath holds one tolerance window per matched
dimension, the half-width in standard deviations of the band a candidate
must fall inside. It is closed by default because the schema already
carries a sensible default for every dimension, and a zero there means
that default is left alone rather than that the window is pinned to
nothing. Reproducing the exact window of a published study is the usual
reason to touch the panel at all, and the panel itself gives the worked
example that *Matching, dimensions and designs* discusses, a frequency k
of 0.111 for a band of the mean plus or minus a ninth of a standard
deviation.

### Lexical decision

A lexical-decision design takes the same lexicon and pool filters and
then asks only for the number of items per condition, words and
pseudowords being equal in number, and for the generator.
`letter_substitution`, the engine default, changes as few single letters
as it can while keeping every bigram attested. `subsyllabic` swaps whole
onset, nucleus and coda constituents in the manner of Wuggy (Keuleers &
Brysbaert, 2010). Both are deterministic, so the pseudowords are the
same ones the package would generate from a script.

### Priming and self-paced reading

These two paradigms read prepared items rather than selecting them, so
no corpus and no matching are involved. The app uses the bundled example
table for the paradigm, `items/priming_pairs_en.csv` or
`items/spr_sentences_en.csv`, and asks only how many counterbalancing
lists to build.

## Running it

‘Run design’ assembles the design, writes it to a `design.yaml` in a
temporary directory with the lexicon and item paths resolved to absolute
ones, and hands it to
[`run_pipeline()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/run_pipeline.md)
with the schema that ships inside the package. Two conditions are
checked first, that a lexicon has been chosen where the paradigm needs
one and that a factorial design defines at least two conditions, and
anything the pipeline itself refuses comes back as the error the
pipeline raised rather than as a generic failure. A successful run
reports how many rows were selected and opens the results.

## Reading the results

The results arrive as six tabs, which between them cover what was
selected, whether it is any good, what it will present and how to
reproduce it.

‘Stimuli’ is the selected set as a table, the same one the run wrote to
disk.

‘Realised control’ is the part that decides whether the set is usable.
It reports Cohen’s *d* against the anchor condition for each controlled
dimension, with its 90% confidence interval, the variance ratio and the
verdict of the two one-sided tests procedure, then draws the absolute
standardised mean difference per dimension as a bar chart with a dashed
line at 0.5 standard deviations. Manipulated dimensions stand well above
that line and matched ones sit near zero, so the shape of the chart is
readable at a glance. The per-condition descriptive statistics follow
underneath. A design drawn from an item table produces no
corpus-matching report, and the tab says so rather than showing an empty
table.

‘Datasheet’ renders the materials datasheet for the run, carrying the
provenance of the corpus, the checksums, the realised control and the
pre-registration skeleton.

‘Experiment scripts’ offers one download per generated experiment, the
PsychoPy script, the OpenSesame `.osexp` and the jsPsych HTML that runs
in a browser, all three compiled from the same trial description.

‘Reproducible code’ is what stops a session in the app from being a dead
end. It shows the design configuration as YAML, with clean
repository-relative paths such as `corpora/derived/en.csv` rather than
the temporary ones the run used, followed by the one-line R, Python and
command-line calls that reproduce the same operation. Saving the YAML
under the name the panel gives it and running any of those three lines
repeats the run outside the app.

‘Download’ packages the design and every artefact the run wrote, the
stimuli, the reports, the datasheet, the run log and the three
experiments, into a single archive named after the design.

## What you leave with

A session in the app ends with the same artefacts a scripted run
produces, which is the point of building it as a front-end rather than
as a separate tool. The design YAML is portable across both engines, so
a set assembled here can be reproduced by a collaborator working in
Python, byte for byte under the deterministic matching methods.
*Reproducibility, parity and the materials datasheet* covers what that
guarantee promises and where it stops, and *Matching, dimensions and
designs* reads the realised-control report column by column.
