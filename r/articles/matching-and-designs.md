# Matching, dimensions and designs

Choosing stimuli is a constrained selection problem. One lexical
property is manipulated, several others must not vary with it, and the
words that satisfy every constraint at once are a small and awkward
subset of the language. This vignette covers how `lexsync` states those
constraints and how it resolves them: the dimensions it computes, the
filters that narrow a lexicon to a candidate pool, the four matching
methods and the situations each one suits, the tolerance windows that
bound an acceptable match, the continuous alternative to a matched
dichotomy, and the report that tells you what control the selection
actually achieved.

Everything below runs on the English example lexicon bundled with the
package, a 3000-word slice that needs no download.

``` r

library(lexsync)
schema <- yaml::read_yaml(
  system.file("extdata", "schema.yaml", package = "lexsync")
)
lex <- load_lexicon(
  system.file("extdata", "en_example.csv", package = "lexsync"),
  schema, language = "english"
)
head(
  lex[, c("word", "frequency", "length", "n_syllables", "n_density", "old20")],
  4
)
```

       word frequency length n_syllables n_density old20
    1   aaa      3.77      3           1        19   1.0
    2   aac      3.00      3           1        22   1.0
    3   aap      3.47      3           1        21   1.0
    4 aaron      4.23      5           2         3   1.8

## The lexical dimensions

A dimension is any numeric column the matcher can equate. `lexsync`
distinguishes those read straight from the lexicon file from those
computed from the orthographic form at load time, and the schema records
the distinction along with each dimension’s unit. Units matter when
reading a report: a raw difference of 1 means one letter on `length` but
a factor of ten in corpus occurrence on `frequency`, which is why the
comparisons are standardised.

``` r

dims <- schema$dimensions
knitr::kable(data.frame(
  dimension = names(dims),
  type = vapply(dims, function(d) d$type, character(1)),
  unit = vapply(dims, function(d) d$unit, character(1)),
  row.names = NULL
), caption = "The dimensions declared in schema.yaml")
```

| dimension   | type    | unit                                                 |
|:------------|:--------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| length      | derived | characters                                           |
| frequency   | column  | Zipf                                                 |
| n_density   | derived | neighbours                                           |
| old20       | derived | mean Levenshtein distance                            |
| n_syllables | derived | syllables (orthographic estimate)                    |
| bigram_freq | derived | mean bigram probability (type-based, non-positional) |

The dimensions declared in schema.yaml {.table}

`length` is the character count of the orthographic form. `frequency` is
the Zipf value read from the lexicon’s `freq_zipf` column, a log-scaled
measure on which roughly 1 is a word occurring once per hundred million
tokens and 7 a word occurring ten thousand times per million. The value
is the base-10 logarithm of the frequency per billion words (van Heuven
et al., 2014). It is preferred to raw counts because it is linear in the
log space in which frequency effects are approximately linear, and
because it is comparable across corpora of different sizes. `n_density`
is Coltheart’s N, the count of same-length words differing by one letter
substitution (Coltheart et al., 1977). `old20` is the mean Levenshtein
distance to the twenty nearest words in the reference set, which unlike
Coltheart’s N is defined for long words, where substitution neighbours
run out (Yarkoni et al., 2008). A larger OLD20 means a more isolated
word, so it runs in the opposite direction to `n_density`.

`n_syllables` also arrives at load time, counting maximal runs of
vowels, an orthographic estimate with no pronunciation model behind it.
Only `bigram_freq` is computed on request, by
[`add_bigram_frequency()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/add_bigram_frequency.md):
it is the mean corpus probability of a word’s adjacent letter bigrams,
standing proxy for phonotactic probability.

``` r

count_syllables(c("cat", "table", "rhythm", "being", "chocolate"))
```

    [1] 1 2 1 1 4

The estimate is worth its caveat, and the errors run in both directions.
It handles `rhythm` because `y` is treated as a vowel letter. It
undercounts `being`, whose `ei` is one run of vowel letters spanning two
nuclei, and it overcounts `chocolate`, whose silent final `e` forms a
run of its own. The measure is adequate for equating two conditions on
gross syllabic complexity and it is not a substitute for a pronunciation
dictionary.

### Computing dimensions on a pool

The bundled lexicon arrives with `n_density` and `old20` already
present, but neighbourhood measures depend on the reference set they are
computed against, so a lexicon derived elsewhere may need them
recomputed.
[`add_neighbourhood()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/add_neighbourhood.md)
does that. Both measures are quadratic in the size of the reference set,
which is why the pipeline computes them on the pool alone, and why the
reference should still be the whole lexicon: a word’s neighbours are its
neighbours in the language, not among the handful of words that survived
your filters.

``` r

sample_words <- lex[lex$word %in% c("cat", "dog", "house", "rhythm"), ]
add_neighbourhood(
  sample_words, reference = lex$word
)[, c("word", "n_density", "old20")]
```

          word n_density old20
    1287 house         0  2.55

[`add_bigram_frequency()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/add_bigram_frequency.md)
works the same way, and
[`merge_norms()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/merge_norms.md)
joins any word-keyed norm table, which is how dimensions the corpus does
not carry (concreteness, age of acquisition, behavioural measures from a
megastudy) become matchable. Once a column is present, the matcher
treats it like any other.

``` r

aoa <- data.frame(word = c("cat", "dog", "house"), aoa = c(3.1, 3.0, 3.4))
merged <- merge_norms(lex, aoa)
merged[merged$word %in% aoa$word, c("word", "frequency", "aoa")]
```

          word frequency aoa
    1287 house      5.71 3.4

The join is case- and whitespace-insensitive on both sides, keeps the
lexicon’s own row and column order, and refuses a norm column whose name
already exists on the lexicon. A silent rename would be the worst
available outcome: it leaves the dimension the design matches on under a
name nothing looks for.

In a design you do not call this yourself. Name the tables in a `norms:`
block and the pipeline joins them before the pool is built, so a norm
column can be filtered on, matched on or spanned like any other
dimension.

``` yaml
norms:
  - path: norms/en_concreteness.csv
    on: word                  # optional join key, default 'word'
    columns: [concreteness]   # optional; default every column but the key

pool_filters:
  concreteness: [2.0, 5.0]
match_on: [length, concreteness]
```

lexsync ships no norm data: licences vary, and the citation is yours to
honour. What it does do is record what you joined. Every table appears
in the materials datasheet with its checksum and its per-column
coverage, because a norm table can supply the very variable a design
manipulates, and a selection over columns of unstated origin is not
reproducible from the record that exists to make it so. Coverage is
recorded for a related reason: a word the table does not cover gets a
missing value, and the tolerance windows then drop it from the pool.

## Pool filters

A pool filter narrows the lexicon before any matching happens. It states
what counts as an eligible word at all, independently of condition, and
it is the right place for constraints you would apply to every item in
the study.

``` r

pool_filters <- list(length = c(3, 7), frequency = c(3.8, 7.0))
pool <- build_pool(lex, pool_filters)
c(lexicon = nrow(lex), pool = nrow(pool))
```

    lexicon    pool 
       3000     782 

A numeric pair is read as an inclusive range. Any other vector is read
as a set of permitted values, so `list(pos = c("noun", "verb"))` would
keep nouns and verbs if the lexicon carried a `pos` column. A filter
naming a column the lexicon does not have is skipped silently, which
keeps one schema usable across corpora that differ in their optional
columns, and which is worth knowing about when a filter appears not to
bite. Rows missing a value on a filtered column are always dropped.

Filtering is a separate step from matching.
[`match_stimuli()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/match_stimuli.md)
reads a design’s `conditions` and `match_on` fields but never its
`pool_filters`, so passing a raw lexicon where a pool was intended
silently widens the selection, with no error to warn you. The pipeline
calls
[`build_pool()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/build_pool.md)
first and the examples here do the same.

## Supplied item pools

Narrowing a whole lexicon is the right way round when any word of the
language will do. It is the wrong way round when the candidate set is
itself a research decision: a list from a previous study, from a norming
session, or one restricted to a semantic category that no lexical filter
can express. Such a list used to have to masquerade as a lexicon, which
meant inventing a `freq_zipf` column for it, or else skip matching
entirely by going in as `items.source: table`.

`items.source: pool` takes the list as it is.

``` yaml
items:
  source: pool
  path: items/pool_en_concrete_nouns.csv
  lexicon: corpora/derived/en.csv
```

The list needs only a `word` column. Length and the syllable estimate
are derived from the form, and `items.lexicon` supplies the rest,
frequency above all, by lookup. A word the lexicon does not have raises
a hard error, because the tolerance windows drop rows with missing
values silently and the pool would then be smaller than it appears to
be.

One subtlety would quietly invalidate the controls if it went the other
way. `n_density` and `old20` are properties of a word in its *language*,
not among the 131 words of a supplied list, so they are computed against
the lexicon’s words. A supplied pool with no lexicon falls back to
itself, which is why one is given above.
[`load_pool()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/load_pool.md)
returns both parts of that, the pool and the reference word list, if you
call it directly outside a design.

Everything downstream is unchanged: the same conditions, the same
`match_on`, the same report, the same datasheet. What differs is only
where the candidates came from, and the datasheet records the list’s
checksum so that stays answerable later. `design_en_supplied_pool.yaml`
is a worked example.

## Relational designs, where the item is a pair

A priming study’s theoretical variable is a property of the *pair*, such
as distributional similarity or associative strength, while its nuisance
variables are properties of each *member*: frequency, length,
neighbourhood. A design could previously have matching, or its own item
table, but not both, so a relational design had to be assembled by hand.

`items.members` promotes an ordinary item table to a pair-keyed one.

``` yaml
items:
  source: table
  path: items/priming_pairs_en.csv
  members: [prime, target]          # the two word fields
  lexicon: corpora/derived/en.csv   # where each member's norms are looked up
  anchor_condition: related         # whose row represents the pair during selection
```

Each member’s word-level norms are joined from the lexicon and prefixed,
giving `prime.frequency`, `target.length` and so on. The member name
leads and the dimension follows, for a reason specific to R:
`prime.frequency` is safe because `df$prime` still exact-matches the
bare `prime` column, whereas `frequency.prime` would be a
partial-matching hazard. Those prefixed names are usable wherever a
dimension is: in `pool_filters`, in `match_on`, as a `continuous`
predictor or as a control.

`pair.lev` is the Levenshtein distance between the two members and
`pair.overlap` is `1 - pair.lev / length of the longer form`, a
normalised orthographic similarity. It scores edit operations, so it is
not a count of shared material: `abc` and `cba` share every letter but
score 0.33. Orthographic overlap is the standard confound control in a
priming design, since a related pair that also shares letters confounds
semantic relatedness with orthographic similarity. The pipeline adds
both automatically when the two members are named `prime` and `target`.
Under any other member names, call
[`add_pair_overlap()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/add_pair_overlap.md)
on the item table yourself. A predictor that cannot be computed from the
forms alone, such as cosine similarity or forward associative strength,
arrives as an extra column on the item table and is used like any other.

``` yaml
n_per_condition: 8                  # counts PAIRS: 8 pairs, 16 rows, 8 per list
pool_filters:
  target.length: [3, 7]
  target.frequency: [3.0, 6.0]
continuous:
  predictor: target.frequency
  controls: [target.length, pair.overlap]
match_on: [target.length, pair.overlap]
```

Two rules follow from the item being a pair. A filter applies to a pair
only if *every* one of its rows passes, and selection runs over one row
per pair, the `anchor_condition`, defaulting to the byte-first
condition, with the result re-expanded afterwards so every condition row
of every chosen pair survives. Neither is an optimisation. A filter on
`prime.frequency` applied row by row would keep a pair’s related row and
drop its unrelated one, leaving a set the Latin-square counterbalancer
cannot complete. Only a dimension that varies within the pair can split
it that way, which the prime-level and pair-level ones do and the
target-level ones do not, since the target is the same word in both
rows.

A member name may not be one of `word`, `id`, `set`, `list`, `trial`,
`condition`, `replicate` or `item`, which the engines read directly, and
a design using one is refused. The datasheet gains a `relational` block
recording the members, the pair count, the member lexicon and its
checksum, and the member-level dimensions separately from the relational
ones. `design_en_priming_continuous.yaml` is the worked example, and its
own comments go further into why each rule is there.

## Conditions, the anchor and matched sets

A condition is a named region of the pool, given by `define_by`, which
is read exactly as `pool_filters` is. The first condition listed is the
anchor. Its items are chosen by an even spread across the sorted
candidate subpool, so the anchor covers the whole of its region on the
manipulated dimension and does not cluster at one end. Every later
condition is then matched to the anchor item by item, and the `set`
column records the pairing.

``` r

design <- list(
  name = "vignette_matching", language = "english", n_per_condition = 20,
  pool_filters = pool_filters,
  conditions = list(
    list(name = "high", define_by = list(frequency = c(5.2, 7.0))),
    list(name = "low",  define_by = list(frequency = c(3.8, 4.4)))
  ),
  match_on = list("length", "n_density", "old20")
)
stim <- match_stimuli(pool, design, schema)
head(
  stim[
    stim$set %in% 1:3,
    c("set", "condition", "word", "frequency", "length", "old20")
  ],
  6
)
```

       set condition    word frequency length old20
    1    1      high    knew      5.20      4  1.75
    2    2      high  energy      5.23      6  2.60
    3    3      high running      5.23      7  1.80
    21   1       low    myth      4.08      4  1.75
    22   2       low  arctic      4.03      6  2.40
    23   3       low blowing      4.20      7  1.80

Because the anchor is spread across its own subpool, the order of the
conditions is a design decision with consequences. The anchor’s
distribution on the manipulated dimension is inherited from the pool,
and every other condition’s distribution is whatever matching to that
anchor produces.

## The four matching methods

The method is set with `matching.method` in a design, or left to the
schema default. All four minimise a distance in standardised space,
computed by z-scoring each `match_on` dimension against the whole pool,
so that a letter and a Zipf unit become comparable. They differ in what
they minimise it over.

`standardised_euclidean`, the default, walks the anchor items in order
and gives each one its nearest unused counterpart, greedily. Because the
anchor is selected before any matching happens, it preserves the
anchor’s even spread exactly. Being anchored, it generalises past two
conditions, as `mahalanobis` does, while `joint` and `optimal` score
cross-condition pairs and are refused with any number of conditions but
two.

`joint` abandons the anchor. It scores every cross-condition pair, then
takes the best-matched pairs in ascending order of distance until it has
enough, so an item with no good counterpart is simply never selected.
This equates the controls more tightly than per-anchor matching when the
manipulation is confounded with a control, and the price is that the
manipulated dimension’s realised distribution is no longer under your
control. It requires exactly two conditions.

`mahalanobis` replaces the Euclidean metric with one weighted by the
inverse of the pool’s correlation matrix, so that dimensions sharing
variance are not counted twice. It suits the case where the matched
dimensions are strongly intercorrelated, which is the normal case for
orthographic measures.

``` r

round(cor(pool[, c("length", "n_density", "old20")]), 2)
```

              length n_density old20
    length      1.00     -0.69  0.76
    n_density  -0.69      1.00 -0.73
    old20       0.76     -0.73  1.00

Length, neighbourhood density and OLD20 are far from independent here.
Under a plain Euclidean metric, matching on all three counts the shared
length-neighbourhood variance three times over and lets an independent
dimension drift. Mahalanobis distance discounts that overlap (Rubin,
1980; Stuart, 2010).

`optimal` keeps the Euclidean metric but solves the pairing globally,
minimising the summed distance over all pairings at once (Gu &
Rosenbaum, 1993; Hansen & Klopfer, 2006). Greedy matching can spend the
one good counterpart of a hard item on an easy item that had
alternatives. Optimal matching cannot. It requires exactly two
conditions and the `clue` package.

``` r

methods <- c("standardised_euclidean", "joint", "mahalanobis")
if (requireNamespace("clue", quietly = TRUE)) methods <- c(methods, "optimal")

summarise_method <- function(method) {
  d <- design
  d$matching <- list(method = method)
  s <- match_stimuli(pool, d, schema)
  cmp <- match_report(
    s, c("frequency", "length", "n_density", "old20"), schema
  )$comparisons
  controls <- cmp[cmp$dimension != "frequency", ]
  high <- s$frequency[s$condition == "high"]
  low  <- s$frequency[s$condition == "low"]
  data.frame(
    method = method,
    worst_control_d = round(max(abs(controls$cohens_d)), 3),
    freq_d = round(cmp$cohens_d[cmp$dimension == "frequency"], 2),
    freq_raw_diff = round(mean(high) - mean(low), 2),
    freq_sd_high = round(sd(high), 2)
  )
}
do.call(rbind, lapply(methods, summarise_method))
```

                      method worst_control_d freq_d freq_raw_diff freq_sd_high
    1 standardised_euclidean           0.038   5.12          1.51         0.39
    2                  joint           0.000   6.94          1.40         0.23
    3            mahalanobis           0.052   5.07          1.49         0.39
    4                optimal           0.000   6.94          1.40         0.23

The comparison rewards a careful reading, and it is a good illustration
of why a standardised difference should not be read as an effect size on
its own. The two globally pairing methods drive the control differences
to zero, because a free choice over all pairs can find counterparts that
match exactly on all three dimensions. Their standardised frequency
separation is also the larger of the four, yet their raw separation in
Zipf units is the smaller. Both facts have one cause: those methods take
whichever pairs match best, and those pairs turn out to cluster, which
shrinks the SD of the high condition and so shrinks the pooled SD that
`freq_d` divides by. A narrower manipulation can raise `d`.

Whether that is a gain depends on the study. The anchor methods keep the
high condition spread across its whole band by construction, which
supports a claim about the band rather than about a cluster inside it,
and it is variance you may want if the manipulation is later modelled as
continuous. The globally pairing methods trade some of that spread for
exact control of the nuisance dimensions. These numbers describe this
pool and this design. The point is how to make the comparison, not which
method wins.

### The parity caveat on two methods

The R and Python engines select byte-identical stimuli under
`standardised_euclidean` and `joint`. They do not guarantee it under
`mahalanobis` or `optimal`. Both of the latter route the distance
through an operation whose last bits are decided by the platform’s
linear-algebra implementation, a covariance-matrix inverse in one case
and an assignment solver in the other, and once two candidate distances
differ in their final bits the tie-break that would otherwise make the
engines agree never fires. `mahalanobis` usually still agrees exactly,
and `optimal` often selects an equally-optimal but different set. Each
run’s datasheet records which case applies, under
`selection.cross_engine`. If cross-engine reproducibility is a
requirement of your project, the two default methods are the ones that
carry the guarantee. The reproducibility vignette sets out why the
exception cannot simply be engineered away.

## Tolerance windows

Matching by distance alone will always return the nearest available
candidate, however far away it is. The tolerance window is the guard
against that. Before the distance ranking, each later condition’s
candidates are filtered to those lying within the anchor’s mean plus or
minus *k* standard deviations on every matched dimension, with *k* set
per dimension.

``` r

str(schema$matching$tolerance_k)
```

    List of 4
     $ length   : num 2
     $ frequency: num 1
     $ n_density: num 2
     $ old20    : num 2

Smaller *k* is stricter. The default of 2.0 on the orthographic
dimensions is permissive, admitting most of a normal distribution, and
it is meant as a backstop against a wild counterpart. The distance
ranking within the window is what does the work of control. A design
tightens the window per dimension, and only the named dimensions are
overridden.

The window belongs to the anchored path, so it is what
`standardised_euclidean` and `mahalanobis` apply. `joint` and `optimal`
score cross-condition pairs directly and never read `tolerance_k` at
all, which is worth knowing before tightening a window and finding the
selection unmoved.

``` r

tight <- design
tight$matching <- list(tolerance_k = list(old20 = 0.25))
tight_stim <- match_stimuli(pool, tight, schema, verbose = TRUE)
round(match_report(tight_stim, "old20", schema)$comparisons$cohens_d, 3)
```

    [1] -0.066

There is a behaviour here that will bite you if you do not know it. If a
window leaves a condition with fewer candidates than there are anchor
items, the matcher neither fails nor returns a short set. It relaxes
that condition’s window and carries on. Tightening the window past what
the pool can supply therefore looks exactly like a window that was never
set, and under the default policy `verbose = TRUE` is the only thing
that tells you which happened.

``` r

too_tight <- design
too_tight$matching <- list(tolerance_k = list(old20 = 0.05))
relaxed_stim <- match_stimuli(pool, too_tight, schema, verbose = TRUE)
```

    lexsync: condition 'low' has 0 candidates within tolerance (< 20 needed); relaxing the window.

Two details of the relaxation matter. It is per condition and it is
all-or-nothing: the fallback drops that condition’s windows on *every*
matched dimension at once, not merely the one that proved unsatisfiable,
so an over-tightened `old20` also discards the `length` and `n_density`
windows for that condition. And it does not degrade the match as much as
you might fear, because the distance ranking still runs over the whole
subpool and still prefers near counterparts. Only when the relaxed
subpool is still too small does the matcher stop, with an error naming
the condition and the counts.

Both behaviours are policies, and the schema’s `matching` block names
them. `on_insufficient_tolerance` governs the fallback just described.
Its default of `relax` keeps the behaviour above, while `error` makes
the matcher refuse and say so, which is the honest setting when the
window is itself the criterion, as it is when reproducing a published
study’s stated windows. `shortfall` governs what happens when fewer sets
than `n_per_condition` can be selected at all, and it defaults to
`error` deliberately: the datasheet and the generated methods paragraph
state the requested n, so a set that silently shrank would leave the
record misstating the materials. A design that can live with fewer sets
says so with `shortfall: allow`, and either key may be overridden under
the design’s own `matching:` block, exactly as `tolerance_k` was
overridden above.

Windows are the place to reproduce a published study’s stated criteria.
The bundled `design_es_gender_repro.yaml` sets `frequency` to
`0.111...`, which is the mean plus or minus SD/9 used by González Alonso
et al. (2025), alongside `length` at the mean plus or minus 2 SD.

One asymmetry is worth knowing. Tolerance windows are derived from the
anchor, so they apply to the anchor-based methods,
`standardised_euclidean` and `mahalanobis`, and to continuous designs.
`joint` and `optimal` never build an anchor and never consult
`tolerance_k`. Both instead cap each subpool to the 1200 candidates
nearest the other condition’s centroid before pairing, which bounds the
cost of scoring every pair.

## Continuous designs

A matched dichotomy is not the only way to study a graded property, and
for a property like frequency it is often not the best one. Splitting a
continuum into a high and a low band discards the variation within each
band, spends statistical power to do it, and leaves the estimate
dependent on where the split was placed. The selection can also
manufacture its own artefacts: Liben-Nowell et al. (2019) show that
choosing a controlled subset from a large candidate set can produce an
apparent effect from a set where none exists, because the selection is
itself a search over the space of possible item sets. Kuperman (2015)
makes the constructive case, that a megastudy’s variation can be used
directly by sampling across a predictor’s range and modelling it.

A `continuous` block does that. Rather than conditions, it names one
predictor to span and the controls to hold still, and the two must agree
with `match_on`.

``` r

cont_design <- list(
  name = "vignette_continuous", language = "english", n_per_condition = 60,
  pool_filters = pool_filters,
  continuous = list(
    predictor = "frequency",
    controls = c("length", "n_density", "old20")
  ),
  match_on = list("length", "n_density", "old20"),
  matching = list(
    tolerance_k = list(length = 1.5, n_density = 1.5, old20 = 1.5)
  )
)
cont <- select_continuous_stimuli(pool, cont_design, schema)
nrow(cont)
```

    [1] 60

``` r

range(cont$frequency)
```

    [1] 3.80 6.85

Selection runs in two passes. An even spread over the pool defines the
control windows from its own distribution, the pool is filtered to those
windows, and a second even spread over what survives is the selection.
The result covers the predictor’s range while the controls stay
near-constant, and therefore near-uncorrelated with the predictor, which
is what the regression needs.

``` r

cont_report <- match_report_continuous(
  cont, "frequency",
  c("length", "n_density", "old20"), schema
)
cont_report$comparisons
```

      dimension      role pearson_r predictor_span
    1 frequency predictor        NA           3.05
    2    length   control    -0.191           3.05
    3 n_density   control     0.112           3.05
    4     old20   control    -0.228           3.05

The report is read differently from a matched one. `predictor_span` is
the realised range of the predictor in the selected set and should be
wide, since it is the variation the regression has to work with. Each
control’s `pearson_r` is its correlation with the predictor and should
be near zero, since a control that still correlates with the predictor
is still a confound. Tightening `tolerance_k` pushes those correlations
down at the cost of a smaller eligible pool, and that is the dial to
turn when a control will not come loose.

The datasheet for a continuous design reports the span, the correlations
and a suggested regression model in which the controls enter as
covariates.

## Reading the validation output

[`match_report()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/match_report.md)
returns two data frames. The descriptives give per-condition n, mean,
SD, minimum, median and maximum for each dimension, which is the table
that belongs in a paper’s materials section.

``` r

report <- match_report(
  stim, c("frequency", "length", "n_density", "old20"), schema
)
knitr::kable(
  report$descriptives,
  caption = "Descriptive statistics per condition"
)
```

Descriptive statistics per condition {.table}

The comparisons contrast every other condition against the anchor on
every dimension, and they carry the four statistics that answer whether
the matching worked.

``` r

knitr::kable(
  report$comparisons,
  caption = paste(
    "Realised control: standardised differences with 90% intervals,",
    "variance ratios and TOST verdicts"
  )
)
```

Realised control: standardised differences with 90% intervals, variance
ratios and TOST verdicts {.table}

`cohens_d` is the standardised mean difference against the anchor, using
the pooled SD. On the manipulated dimension it should be large and on a
controlled dimension it should be near zero.

`d_ci_low` and `d_ci_high` bound it with a 90% confidence interval. The
interval, not the point estimate, is the primary summary of a controlled
dimension. Its upper limit is the largest imbalance still consistent
with the stimuli you have, and with few items that limit can be
substantial even when the point estimate is almost zero. Reporting the
interval keeps the dependence on set size visible, where a bare ‘no
significant difference’ hides it. The width is a property of the number
of items, so a small set cannot demonstrate tight control however good
its point estimates look (Sassenhagen & Alday, 2016).

`var_ratio` is the condition’s variance over the anchor’s. Two
conditions can share a mean and still confound if one is far more spread
out than the other, which every mean-based statistic misses, so this is
the distributional check. A ratio near 1 is balanced and a common
heuristic flags ratios outside roughly 0.5 to 2. See
[`?variance_ratio`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/variance_ratio.md)
for the sources behind that heuristic.

`tost_p` and `equivalent` are the two one-sided tests. A conventional
non-significant difference test is not evidence of equivalence, because
failing to reject a null is not the same as supporting it, and the
failure is easiest to achieve with few items and noisy measures. TOST
inverts this by testing against an explicit bound: the reported p is the
larger of two one-sided p-values against a difference of plus or minus
`bound_d` pooled SDs, and a value below alpha supports equivalence
within that bound (Lakens, 2017). The bound and alpha are the schema’s,
so the verdict is only as meaningful as the bound you chose.

``` r

str(schema$equivalence)
```

    List of 2
     $ bound_d: num 0.5
     $ alpha  : num 0.05

A bound of 0.5 SD is the schema default and it is a convention rather
than a finding. It is a permissive bound for a nuisance dimension in a
design where that dimension has a strong effect on the response, and a
study that cares about a particular confound should set a bound it can
defend. The 90% interval is the 1 - 2 x alpha interval precisely so that
it corresponds to the TOST decision at alpha: the test declares
equivalence exactly when the interval falls entirely inside the bounds,
which means the interval and the verdict are two readings of one thing.

The individual statistics are exported and can be called directly on any
two vectors.

``` r

high <- stim$old20[stim$condition == "high"]
low  <- stim$old20[stim$condition == "low"]
str(cohens_d_ci(high, low))
```

    List of 3
     $ d      : num 0.0254
     $ ci_low : num -0.508
     $ ci_high: num 0.559

``` r

str(tost_equiv(high, low, bound_d = 0.5))
```

    List of 2
     $ p         : num 0.0708
     $ equivalent: logi FALSE

``` r

round(variance_ratio(low, high), 3)
```

    [1] 0.734

[`balance_check()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/balance_check.md)
is the last piece and answers a different question: whether the levels
of a column occur equally often. It returns human-readable warnings and
an empty vector when all is well, and the pipeline logs whatever it
returns.

``` r

balance_check(stim, "condition")
```

    character(0)

``` r

balance_check(rbind(stim, stim[1, ]), "condition")
```

    [1] "Column 'condition' is unbalanced: high=21, low=20"

## Pseudowords

Lexical decision needs non-words, and the difficulty is that they must
be orthographically plausible without being real.
[`build_lexdec_stimuli()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/build_lexdec_stimuli.md)
draws real words by an even spread across the byte-ordered pool, then
generates a length-matched pseudoword for each.

``` r

lexdec_pool <- build_pool(lex, list(length = c(4, 7), frequency = c(3.5, 6.0)))
stim_lexdec <- build_lexdec_stimuli(
  lexdec_pool, n = 8, reference_words = lex$word
)
head(stim_lexdec[, c("target", "condition", "length", "set")], 4)
```

       target condition length set
    1   aaron      word      5   1
    2 carrier      word      7   2
    3 erected      word      7   3
    4   house      word      5   4

The presented string is `target`, the conditions are `word` and
`pseudoword`, and `set` pairs each word with its non-word twin.
`reference_words` should be the full lexicon: it supplies the bigram
statistics and the list of real forms a pseudoword must avoid, and it
defaults to the pool when omitted, which is rarely what you want.

Two methods are available, chosen per design under
`items.generation.method`.

`letter_substitution`, the default, changes as few letters as possible
subject to three constraints: every resulting bigram must be attested in
the corpus, the form must not be a real word or one already generated,
and the length must be preserved exactly. Single substitutions are
searched first, then pairs as a fallback. Among the legal candidates the
most bigram-plausible wins, with a byte-order tie-break.

`subsyllabic` splits each word into onset, nucleus and coda constituents
and swaps whole constituents for attested alternatives of the same role
and length, so the pseudowords keep their syllabic structure. Codas and
nuclei are changed before onsets, which carry the most identifying
orthography. Roughly two thirds of a word’s constituents are targeted,
each swap preserves length, and a word with no legal swap falls back to
letter substitution, so every word yields a pseudoword. It is a
deterministic orthographic approximation of Wuggy (Keuleers & Brysbaert,
2010), trading Wuggy’s phonological model for exact length matching and
cross-engine reproducibility.

``` r

sub_stim <- build_lexdec_stimuli(
  lexdec_pool, n = 8, reference_words = lex$word, method = "subsyllabic"
)
# The real words come first in the frame, so pair each with its twin by `set`.
merge(
  sub_stim[sub_stim$condition == "word", c("set", "target")],
  sub_stim[sub_stim$condition == "pseudoword", c("set", "target")],
  by = "set", suffixes = c("_word", "_pseudoword")
)[1:4, ]
```

      set target_word target_pseudoword
    1   1       aaron             ierer
    2   2     carrier           cinrees
    3   3     erected           aristar
    4   4       house             reesi

Both generators process base words in byte order, so the set of
already-used pseudowords evolves identically in the two engines and both
select byte-identical stimuli. Both are also orthographic models defined
for a-z words:
[`build_lexdec_stimuli()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/build_lexdec_stimuli.md)
filters the pool to those, and the subsyllabic segmenter returns nothing
for a word with an accent, a hyphen or a digit, which sends it down the
letter-substitution path. That is why lexical decision is demonstrated
on the English designs and never on the Chinese one.

[`generate_pseudowords()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/generate_pseudowords.md)
and
[`make_pseudoword()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/make_pseudoword.md)
are available directly if you want the forms without the
lexical-decision scaffolding around them.

``` r

generate_pseudowords(c("house", "table"), lex$word)
```

      base_word pseudoword
    1     house      hoese
    2     table      talle

In a design this is `items.source: generate`, with the method under
`items.generation.method`. `design_en_lexdec.yaml` and
`design_en_lexdec_wuggy.yaml` are the worked examples of the two
methods, and `design_en_lexdec_blocks.yaml` adds practice and filler
blocks to the same generated set.

## Items as a random factor

A matched set is one sample from the language, and an analysis that
treats its items as fixed generalises to those items rather than to the
language they were drawn from (Clark, 1973; Yarkoni, 2022). Crossed
random effects are the standard answer, and the datasheet suggests a
model that includes them.
[`resample_stimuli()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/resample_stimuli.md)
supports the stronger move of drawing several fully matched sets that
share no items, each one an independent sample, which lets a study run
different item samples across participant groups or show that an effect
survives the change of materials.

``` r

reps <- resample_stimuli(pool, design, schema, n_sets = 2)
table(reps$replicate, reps$condition)
```

       
        high low
      1   20  20
      2   20  20

``` r

length(intersect(
  reps$word[reps$replicate == 1],
  reps$word[reps$replicate == 2]
))
```

    [1] 0

Each replicate is matched independently against the pool with the
earlier replicates’ items removed, so the sets are disjoint by
construction. Later replicates draw from a depleted pool, which means
match quality can degrade across replicates. The report will show it if
it does.
