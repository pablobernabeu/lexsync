# Changelog

## lexsync (development version)

- The package now declares `Depends: R (>= 4.0.0)`.
  [`tools::R_user_dir`](https://rdrr.io/r/tools/userdir.html) does not
  exist before 4.0.0, and
  [`round()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html)’s post-4.0 algorithm
  shapes artefact bytes, so an older R would fail obscurely or write
  different bytes without complaint.
- The published median goes through the exact reductions.
  [`describe_stimuli()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/describe_stimuli.md)
  was the one reduction still on
  [`stats::median`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/median.html), which averages
  the two middle values through
  [`mean()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/mean.html)’s long-double accumulator
  while the Python engine reduced through numpy. Both engines now sort
  and take the exact middle, with `(a + b) / 2` in plain double
  arithmetic for even n, and regenerating every design moved no byte.
  *Reproducibility and parity* claimed that every reduction shared one
  compensated-summation algorithm, which the median never did, and now
  describes the sort-and-middle rule beside it.
- The dead half of the two-shortest-forms CSV guard now fires. Between
  2^49 and 1e15 two one-decimal strings can round-trip to the same
  double, and the R check derived its digit count from a 15-digit format
  that never shows a fractional digit there, so R accepted values
  (844424930131968.2 among them) that the Python writer refused. R now
  refuses exactly the same values, and the change only adds refusals.
- A condition without `define_by` selects identically in both engines.
  This engine always fell back to the whole pool. The Python engine
  crashed with a bare KeyError on the same design and now mirrors the
  fallback, pinned by twin tests.
- A pair design’s tolerance-window relaxation reaches the run log and
  datasheet. The continuous-pairs selector’s re-expansion dropped the
  audit in both engines, so a relaxed window left no trace outside the
  console. No shipped pair design relaxes, so no committed artefact
  changed.
- `INTER_TRIGGER_S` is substituted through `%.17g` like its neighbours
  in the generated PsychoPy script. It used
  [`as.character()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html), whose
  rendering of a non-integer quotient differs from Python’s
  [`str()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/str.html). The shipped default still
  renders “0.01”, so no committed experiment byte moved.
- The counterbalancing hash keys convert to UTF-8 before hashing, as
  `hash_unit()` always has, so a latin1-marked condition read from a
  user’s CSV can no longer rank by different digests in the two engines.
- The command-line wrapper reports which copy of the package it loaded.
  `R_workflow/run_pipeline.R` prefers an installed lexsync over the
  edited sources, so edits silently did nothing until a reinstall. It
  now states the loaded copy and the remedy on stderr at startup.
- The Shiny app writes its design YAML with LF endings through a binary
  connection (the datasheet hashes that file into `design_sha256`, which
  must not depend on the operating system), and its parity caption now
  matches the keyed-hash guarantee: the engines produce byte-identical
  stimuli and trial order, where the caption used to promise only the
  stimuli. The Python engine’s twin fixes land in the same release: its
  writer refuses 16-digit integer columns as this engine always has, its
  scalar rounder passes an overflowing scale through, and
  `run_pipeline(verbose = FALSE)` keeps its console silent.
- A selection that cannot honour `n_per_condition` is now an error.
  Every selector used to clip the request to the available pool and said
  so at most through a verbose message, while the datasheet and the
  generated Methods text kept stating the requested n. The new
  `matching: shortfall` policy defaults to `error`, and `allow` accepts
  the shrink. Its sibling `matching: on_insufficient_tolerance` (default
  `relax`) can likewise turn the silent tolerance-window widening into a
  refusal, and a relaxation that does happen is now recorded in the run
  log and the datasheet (`selection.window_relaxations`), where before
  it was only narrated to the console. No committed design experiences
  either condition.
- `joint` and `optimal` matching can no longer select the same word
  twice. With overlapping condition windows a word could be paired with
  itself at zero cost, or mirrored across two sets, appearing in both
  conditions. Both matchers now track used words as the anchored matcher
  always has, and every matcher asserts its output holds each word at
  most once. Every committed design has disjoint conditions, and those
  select identically, byte for byte.
- The item-table loader refuses missing cells in both engines. A blank
  `condition` reached Python’s hash-key guard as the string “nan” and
  passed the very check built to refuse it, a blank `item` cell turned
  numeric identifiers into “1.0”, and R failed on the same table with a
  bare “missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed”. Missingness is now
  checked before any coercion, `item` is read as text, empties after
  trimming and duplicated item-and-condition rows are refused, and both
  engines say the same thing.
- Cohen’s d no longer reports perfect balance for two unequal constant
  vectors. The standardised difference is undefined when the pooled SD
  is zero and the means differ, so it is now reported as missing. The
  old 0 with CI \[0, 0\] contradicted the TOST verdict on the same row.
- The datasheet’s Methods prose follows the recorded verdicts. The claim
  of being “within the 0.5-SD equivalence bound” was printed for any
  controlled dimension with a confidence interval, even where the
  datasheet’s own JSON recorded `equivalent: false`. The sentence is now
  conditional on the stored verdicts, prints the signed worst difference
  and the configurable bound, and the analysis note names the suggested
  formula as `lme4` syntax, where it used to imply that `statsmodels`
  accepts it. The datasheet also gains the SHA-256 of the design and
  schema, the pairwise matchers’ candidate cap and whether it fired, the
  equivalence bound tested against, and the `yaml`, `stringi` and
  operating-system entries the environment record omitted.
- A `continuous` block now works over a supplied pool, and two silent
  table-mode gaps are refusals. `source: pool` reaches the continuous
  selector (it previously fell through to the conditions matcher and
  crashed). A continuous table without `members` is an error now, as is
  `pool_filters` on a plain table design, where each used to do nothing
  silently while the provenance recorded otherwise. Misspelt
  `pool_filters` or `define_by` columns, duplicate condition names,
  reversed or non-finite ranges, negative tolerances and non-integer n
  are likewise refusals now.
- Selection-path rounding goes through the shared decimal rule
  (`.round_dp` and a new vectorised numpy twin), replacing a pairing of
  R’s [`round()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html) with numpy’s, two
  rounders the project measured to disagree at boundaries. Regenerating
  all 21 designs moved no stimulus, report or experiment byte. A custom
  norm named in `match_on` now also reaches the descriptives,
  comparisons and realised-control record, which previously listed only
  the built-in dimensions.
- A design file could execute code on the machine that ran it. A design
  is meant to be shared, and the recipient runs it and then opens the
  generated PsychoPy script, OpenSesame experiment or jsPsych page.
  Stimulus text was always safe: it travels in the loop-table CSV the
  experiment reads at run time. Design *metadata* was not. The name,
  language label, font, parallel-port address and the column names on
  jitter and feedback events were substituted straight into code and
  markup positions, so a quote or an angle bracket there stopped being
  text and became syntax, and a crafted design could run arbitrary code
  on a lab machine or in the origin of a hosted browser study. Both
  engines now validate these values, under one rule that leaves every
  legitimate value byte-identical. A port address must be an address, a
  column name must be an identifier, and a stated `language_tag` is
  shape-checked before it is used. Escaping them correctly would have
  taken three rules per engine. `.pyq()` escapes newlines now as well:
  an `.osexp` is line-oriented, so a raw newline closed the
  inline-script block and let the rest of the value start a new
  top-level item. Pinned by `test-injection.R`. No generated artefact
  changed. Adversarially attacking that fix then found four ways through
  it, all now closed and pinned. The largest: a response event’s `keys`
  were joined into OpenSesame’s `set allowed_responses "a;b"` with no
  validation at all, and that is one line of a line-oriented format, so
  a key holding a double quote closed the string, a newline ended the
  line, and the rest of the value became new top-level items in the
  experiment, including an `inline_script` whose body OpenSesame runs.
  Keys are validated now. The shape guards were also anchored with `$`,
  which in both Python’s `re` and R’s PCRE matches just before a final
  newline, so a port address ending in one passed the check. They are
  anchored at end-of-string now. A scalar `keys: space` or
  `blocks: practice` was iterated character by character in Python and
  kept whole in R, so one design gave two different allowed-response
  lists and a block-restricted event ran everywhere in one engine and
  nowhere in the other. And R’s HTML escape did not cover U+2028/U+2029,
  which end a line in JavaScript but are not ASCII controls: Python
  escaped them, R did not, so the same design produced different bytes
  and R’s `<script>` was a syntax error before ES2019.
- A browser experiment could score a feedback screen against the
  previous trial’s keypress. The jsPsych feedback screen looked up “the
  last row marked scoreable”, which is that trial’s response only when
  the trial has one. An event may be restricted to a block, so a design
  running the response event in one block and feedback in another leaves
  a trial with no response row of its own, and the screen then reported
  a verdict computed from an earlier trial’s key. Each trial’s rows now
  carry its own identifier and the screen matches on it. The generated
  HTML changed for all 21 designs. No stimulus selection changed.
- A large number in a user’s own column was written differently by the
  two engines.
  [`write_csv_utf8()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/write_csv_utf8.md)
  reproduced readr’s format for small magnitudes and left the top end
  alone, since nothing lexsync computes reaches it. Nothing lexsync
  computes does. A joined norm table, a supplied pool or an item table
  carries whatever columns the user has, and those go straight into the
  stimuli CSV, so the guarantee held for the shipped designs and failed
  silently for the user’s own data. readr’s layout above 1e15 could not
  be reproduced in Python, which writes 1.5e16 as `15e15`, the largest
  double as `17976931348623157e292`, and the double nearest 5e22 as
  `4.9999999999999996e+22`. Both engines now refuse such a value and
  name the column. One engine accepting it would leave the two writing
  different bytes. A value with two equally short decimal forms is
  refused for the same reason. Everything verified to render
  identically, across 465 values compared against readr’s own output,
  writes as before.
- A generated OpenSesame experiment with a `feedback` event or a
  `blocks:` restriction would not run. The emitter wrote `unicode(...)`,
  a Python 2 builtin that OpenSesame’s Python 3 inline workspace does
  not provide, so the experiment died with `NameError` on the first
  trial. It also passed `None` as a `var.get()` default, which
  OpenSesame cannot distinguish from no default, so it raises where it
  should return. Both are fixed, both spellings are now pinned by a
  test, and a `feedback` event with no preceding `response` or
  `question` is refused at generation time. Left to run time, that one
  design error would surface as three different failures, one per
  target.
- Reported statistics are rounded by an arithmetic definition both
  engines compute identically, because no pairing of built-ins agreed.
  Measured over 210,000 values, including every three-decimal halfway
  case in range, R’s [`round()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/Round.html)
  disagrees with Python’s builtin, Python’s builtin disagrees with
  numpy’s, and even R’s `sprintf("%.3f")` disagrees with Python’s
  `"%.3f"` on 274 of them. Some values move by one in the last published
  digit. No selection changes.
- A hash-key component that cannot be rendered identically in both
  engines is now refused rather than hashed. A blank `condition` cell, a
  routine data error neither reader rejects, rendered `"NA"` in R and
  `"nan"` in Python, so the two engines produced different trial orders
  from the same design, reproducibly and with nothing to signal it.
  Booleans get a pinned spelling and are still accepted.
- The overlap-cap centroid in the `joint` and `optimal` matchers goes
  through the compensated reduction. The cap does fire on shipped
  designs, so it decides which candidates reach matching. It was
  verified to change no design’s selection.
- `R CMD check --as-cran` is clean: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 1 note (the
  standard new-submission note). Fixed on the way: three undocumented
  arguments on
  [`select_continuous_stimuli()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/select_continuous_stimuli.md),
  an unqualified [`utils::head()`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/head.html),
  and the package’s only example, which called an unexported function
  from inside `\dontrun{}` and so could never have worked if a user
  copied it. The package now has executable, offline examples, and
  `cran-comments.md` no longer misstates the check result.
- Three factual corrections. The SUBTLEX-PT registry entry cited a DOI
  that resolves to an unrelated psychometrics paper. The matching
  vignette put Zipf 7 at a thousand occurrences per million where the
  correct figure is ten thousand, contradicting its own lower anchor. A
  design comment attributed “840-prime materials” to Rastle et
  al. (2004), a figure that appears nowhere in that paper.
- A design may declare `practice:` and `fillers:` item tables. Those
  trials are presented but not analysed, so the stimuli file and the
  reports are written from the main rows while the generated experiments
  run every trial. Practice comes first. Fillers are interleaved with
  the main trials, because a block of fillers at the end is not a filler
  but a second block a participant can tell apart. A design declaring
  neither is unaffected, down to not gaining a `block` column.
- A `feedback` trial event, and a `blocks:` key that restricts any event
  to named blocks. Together these confine feedback to practice, which is
  the usual arrangement: feedback teaches the mapping, and would
  contaminate the reaction times it is measuring. Implemented for
  PsychoPy, OpenSesame and jsPsych alike. The PsychoPy runner now
  returns the pressed key so it can be scored, and each runner pauses at
  a block boundary.
- The Python engine embedded a bare `NaN` in the generated jsPsych
  experiment where a trial had no value for a field another block
  supplies (a main-block trial in a design whose practice items carry an
  `answer`). That is not valid JSON, and the R engine dropped the key
  instead, so the two engines’ experiments differed. Both now drop it.
- The generated artefacts were not byte-identical across the engines,
  and the parity test could not see it. It read both CSVs back with a
  parser and compared the values, under which `1` and `1.0` are the same
  number. Thirteen of the 18 shipped designs differed byte for byte
  while the gate stayed green. Three differences were serialisation (a
  whole number written `1` and `1.0`, a boolean written `FALSE` and
  `False`, a small value written `9e-4` and `0.0009`) and one was not:
  two reported means differed in the last decimal published, because
  numpy sums pairwise and R’s
  [`mean()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/mean.html) does not. Every reduction
  in the package now uses one compensated-summation algorithm written
  out in both engines, whose agreement follows from IEEE-754 and no
  longer from measurement. The writers agree on every value, and the
  artefacts are now compared as bytes. No R golden moved, because R’s
  two-pass mean was already the correctly-rounded one.
- A response key coded `f` was silently turned into `FALSE`. `readr`
  reads a column whose values are all `f`, `t`, `T` or `F` as logical,
  while pandas keeps the string, so an item table using the commonest
  two-choice key pair had its correct answer corrupted in one engine.
  Item tables now read the condition label and the paradigm’s presented
  fields as text in both engines.
- `jsonlite`’s default of four digits was truncating the datasheet: a
  design declaring `tolerance_k: 0.1111111111111111` had it recorded as
  `0.1111`, which does not reproduce the run the record exists to
  describe. The JSON is now written at full display precision, and the
  Python engine writes the same precision.
- New paradigm `categorisation`: a category cue, then the word to judge
  against it, with `answer` holding the correct response key so the data
  are scoreable. Counterbalanced by Latin-square rotation, so a
  participant never sees the same target twice.
- `counterbalance.optimise` (off by default) assigns item sets to lists
  so the lists are equated on the declared dimensions, where the old
  deal went by set rank. The search is a deterministic integer descent
  with a keyed-hash tie-break, so it uses no random number generator and
  both engines produce the same assignment.
  [`balance_lists()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/balance_lists.md)
  is exported.
- New item source `pool`: a supplied word list goes through the matcher
  without having to masquerade as a corpus lexicon.
  [`load_pool()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/load_pool.md)
  is exported. The neighbourhood dimensions are computed against the
  lexicon’s words, because a word’s neighbours are its neighbours in the
  language.
- A design may name norm tables in a `norms:` block. They are joined
  onto the lexicon before the candidate pool is built, so a semantic
  dimension the corpus does not carry (concreteness, age of acquisition,
  valence) can be filtered on, matched on or spanned like any other. No
  norm data is bundled. Every joined table is recorded in the materials
  datasheet with its checksum and its per-column coverage, because a
  norm table can supply the very variable a design manipulates.
- Datasheet version 1.1. It adds `materials_source$norms` and, for a
  pair-keyed design, a `relational` block naming the members, the pair
  count, the member lexicon and its checksum, and the member-level
  dimensions separately from the relational ones.
  `selection$cross_engine` no longer reports “n/a (user-supplied items)”
  for a pair-keyed continuous design: that design does perform a
  selection, and it is byte-identical across engines.
- [`merge_norms()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/merge_norms.md)
  returns the lexicon with the norm columns appended, in the lexicon’s
  own row *and column* order. It previously used
  [`merge()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/merge.html), which hoists the join
  column to position 1 where pandas keeps the left frame’s order, so the
  two engines disagreed on column order whenever `on` was not already
  first. The join key is now case- and whitespace-folded on the
  lexicon’s side too, where only the norm table’s was folded before: a
  lexicon holding `Dog` used to match nothing and leave an all-`NA`
  dimension. A norm column whose name already exists on the lexicon is
  now an error. Renaming it to `frequency.x` / `frequency.y`, as
  [`merge()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/merge.html) did, left the matched
  dimension under a name nothing looks for.
- [`write_datasheet()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/write_datasheet.md)
  and
  [`write_run_log()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/write_run_log.md)
  now write LF on every platform. They used a text-mode connection, so
  on Windows the datasheet, its Markdown rendering and the Markdown run
  log came out CRLF while the Python engine’s twins were LF. The
  datasheet is the provenance record. Its bytes no longer depend on the
  machine that built it.
- [`add_pair_overlap()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/add_pair_overlap.md)
  and
  [`resolve_trial_timing()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/resolve_trial_timing.md)
  are now exported in fact as well as in the documentation. Both were
  marked for export and documented, but the `NAMESPACE` had not been
  regenerated, so
  [`library(lexsync)`](https://github.com/pablobernabeu/lexsync) did not
  make them available.
- The materials datasheet now reports the candidate-pool size per
  condition (selection transparency, making item-selection bias
  auditable) and a suggested crossed mixed-model formula that guards
  against the language-as-fixed-effect fallacy.
- Browser (jsPsych) experiments gain a welcome/instructions screen,
  per-row item metadata (condition, item id, list), and a completion
  screen that saves the collected data as a CSV download.
- The realised-control report and datasheet gain a variance ratio per
  dimension, a distributional balance check that complements Cohen’s d
  and TOST.
- Wuggy-style subsyllabic pseudoword generation (opt-in
  `items.generation.method: subsyllabic`): whole onset/nucleus/coda
  constituents are swapped for attested same-role, same-length
  alternatives, preserving syllabic structure and length. Byte-identical
  across engines, and the default letter-substitution generator is
  unchanged.
- Continuous (non-dichotomised) design mode: declare a `continuous`
  block and
  [`select_continuous_stimuli()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/select_continuous_stimuli.md)
  spans a predictor’s range evenly while holding the controls
  near-constant, with predictor-control correlations and a regression
  suggested-model in the datasheet. Byte-identical across the R and
  Python engines.
- Two new matching methods: `mahalanobis` (a covariance-aware distance
  that down-weights correlated dimensions) and `optimal` (a globally
  optimal assignment for two-condition designs, using the suggested
  `clue` package). Unlike the default methods, these use a covariance
  inverse and an assignment solver, so the R and Python engines agree
  closely but not byte-for-byte on them.
- An unknown `matching.method`, and a candidate pool too small for the
  requested `n_per_condition`, now raise an actionable error. Each used
  to fall back silently, to a default method or to a short set. The
  Python engine raises the same message, and code that relied on the old
  fallback will now stop.
- `stringi` is a new hard dependency (Imports). The canonical word key
  is case-folded with ICU at the root locale, so the key no longer
  depends on the machine’s locale and matches the Python engine byte for
  byte. `shiny`, `bslib`, `DT` and `zip` are new Suggests, for the Shiny
  app.
- Ten functions are newly exported, matching the Python package’s public
  surface:
  [`PARADIGMS()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/PARADIGMS.md),
  [`build_datasheet()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/build_datasheet.md),
  [`build_lexdec_stimuli()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/build_lexdec_stimuli.md),
  [`count_syllables()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/count_syllables.md),
  [`generate_pseudowords()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/generate_pseudowords.md),
  [`make_pseudoword()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/make_pseudoword.md),
  [`methods_paragraph()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/methods_paragraph.md),
  [`required_fields()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/required_fields.md),
  [`resolve_events()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/resolve_events.md)
  and
  [`write_datasheet()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/write_datasheet.md).
- [`tost_equiv()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/tost_equiv.md)
  now defaults to `bound_d = 0.5`, the value the Python engine already
  used. The R default was 0.4, so the equivalence bound is wider and a
  comparison is easier to declare equivalent. Reported verdicts can
  change for the same data.
- [`describe_stimuli()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/describe_stimuli.md)
  now orders rows by each group’s first appearance, matching pandas.
  This changes the row order of generated descriptives.
- OpenSesame experiments now present trials in the seeded
  counterbalanced order. The order was previously randomised again at
  run time, so what ran was not what the pipeline generated and
  recorded.
- Breaking change: trial order within each counterbalancing list now
  comes from a seeded, keyed-hash shuffle shared with the Python engine.
  Each row is ranked by the SHA-256 digest of
  `seed|replicate|list|set|condition`, a tuple that identifies the trial
  uniquely under either counterbalancing recipe, so the permutation is a
  pure function of the design: byte-identical from both engines on any
  platform, and different for every seed. Previously the order was drawn
  from [`sample()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html), which could
  never match numpy’s generator for the same seed, so the trial lists
  were the one engine-specific artefact. All 75 generated experiment
  files across the 15 designs bundled at the time are now byte-identical
  across the engines, and the parity gate now compares the `trial`
  column of the stimuli CSVs. Stimulus selection, pairing and lists are
  unchanged, but every design’s trial order changes relative to the
  previous artefacts. The package no longer uses R’s random-number
  generator at all, so a seeded run cannot perturb the calling script’s
  random stream and there is no RNG state to save or restore.
- [`merge_norms()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/merge_norms.md)
  preserves the lexicon’s row order, and
  [`participant_table()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/participant_table.md)
  crosses factors in
  [`expand.grid()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/expand.grid.html) order in
  both engines.
- Datasheets record the tolerance windows and pseudoword generator that
  ran, filter dimensions as the Python engine does, and report the
  installed package version they were built by.
- [`match_stimuli()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/match_stimuli.md)
  raises where it used to re-pick an already-used row, when a relaxed
  window re-admits candidates missing a matched dimension. Such a
  candidate has no defined distance and is never assigned, yet it still
  counted towards the pool-size guard. An NA-depleted pool could
  therefore pass the guard and go on to emit the same word in several
  sets.
- [`match_stimuli()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/match_stimuli.md)
  and
  [`select_continuous_stimuli()`](https://pablobernabeu.github.io/lexsync/r/reference/select_continuous_stimuli.md)
  no longer select an all-NA row when the tolerance window is NA (an
  anchor of a single item gives `sd = NA`). An undecided comparison now
  resolves to `FALSE`, as it does in Python, so the window is relaxed
  and a real word is selected.
- The generated PsychoPy script, OpenSesame experiment and jsPsych page
  are now byte-identical to the Python engine’s, trial lists included
  (see the keyed-hash shuffle entry above).
- Selected stimuli are unchanged for all 15 designs bundled at the time.
- Every vignette now turns console colour off and fixes the console
  width while it renders. pkgdown passes the calling terminal’s colour
  support into its build subprocess, so a coloured message or error
  would otherwise reach the reader as escape sequences in the middle of
  the text.
- See the top-level `CHANGELOG.md` for the full, cross-language history
  and the planned methodological roadmap.

## lexsync 0.1.0

- First release: multilingual corpus access, parallel multidimensional
  matching, counterbalancing, item resampling, deterministic pseudoword
  generation, and generation of hardware-timed PsychoPy, OpenSesame and
  jsPsych experiments. The R and Python engines select byte-identical
  stimuli, and every run ships a materials datasheet (provenance,
  checksums, realised control) and a pre-registration template.
