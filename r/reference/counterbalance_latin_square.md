# One row per item per list, condition rotated across lists (Latin square)

Each item (`set`) contributes exactly one trial to a list, so its target
is never repeated within a list; conditions are balanced because items
rotate through them. With `lists` unset the number of lists equals the
number of conditions. Mirrors the Python recipe (byte-order condition
list, zero-based rotation), so the two engines assign the same condition
to each item per list.

## Usage

``` r
counterbalance_latin_square(stimuli, design, schema)
```
