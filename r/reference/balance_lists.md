# Assign item sets to counterbalancing lists so the lists match on the item dimensions

The factorial recipe's default deal is by set rank, which balances
nothing. This searches instead for an assignment whose lists have
near-equal totals on each declared dimension, by steepest-descent
pairwise swaps between lists. List sizes are preserved, because a swap
exchanges one set for another.

## Usage

``` r
balance_lists(stimuli, design, schema)
```

## Arguments

- stimuli:

  A stimuli data frame with a `set` column and the balance dimensions.

- design:

  A parsed design configuration. Reads `counterbalance.lists`,
  `counterbalance.balance_on` (defaulting to `match_on`, then to the
  continuous predictor and controls) and `counterbalance.max_passes`.

- schema:

  The parsed global schema (provides the seed).

## Value

A list with `list_of_set` (a named integer vector mapping each set to a
list) and `report` (the dimensions, the integer cost before and after,
the number of swaps taken, and whether the pass bound was reached).

## Details

The search is deterministic and identical in the R and Python engines:
the objective is all-integer (see the notes in this file), the descent
takes the single best swap each pass, and ties are broken by the seeded
keyed hash rather than by position, so no list is favoured by being
numbered first. Because the cost is a non-negative integer that strictly
decreases, the search terminates; `max_passes` bounds it anyway and the
report says whether the bound was reached.

Five situations are refused rather than answered with an assignment that
would mislead. A Latin-square design is refused because every item
already appears in every list there, so there is nothing left to equate,
and fewer than two lists leaves no pair of lists to exchange sets
between. A design with no resolvable balance dimension is refused, as is
one naming a dimension the stimuli do not carry, and the message names
the columns. The last refusal is arithmetic: the search stops if the
integer objective would leave the range a double represents exactly,
since past that point the two engines could disagree.
