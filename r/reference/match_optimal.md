# Optimal (minimum-total-distance) pairing for a two-condition design

Solves the linear-assignment problem globally rather than greedily, so
it minimises the summed pair distance and leaves fewer poorly matched
pairs (Gu and Rosenbaum, 1993; Hansen & Klopfer, 2006). Needs the 'clue'
package. The solver's tie handling differs from the Python engine's, so
the two agree closely but not byte-for-byte.

## Usage

``` r
match_optimal(
  subpools,
  cond_names,
  match_on,
  center,
  scale_,
  n,
  cap = .PAIRWISE_CAP
)
```
